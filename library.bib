abstract = {With anthropogenic nutrient inputs to ecosystems increasing globally, there are long-standing, fundamental questions about the role of nutrients in the decomposition of organic matter. We tested the effects of exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus inputs on litter decomposition across a broad suite of litter and soil types. In one experiment, C mineralization was compared across a wide array of plants individually added to a single soil, while in the second, C mineralization from a single substrate was compared across 50 soils. Counter to basic stoichiometric decomposition theory, low N availability can increase litter decomposition as microbes use labile substrates to acquire N from recalcitrant organic matter. This "microbial nitrogen mining" is consistently suppressed by high soil N supply or substrate N concentrations. There is no evidence for phosphorus mining as P fertilization increases short- and long-term mineralization. These results suggest that basic stoichiometric decomposition theory needs to be revised and ecosystem models restructured accordingly in order to predict ecosystem carbon storage responses to anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability.},

abstract = {Strain 853-15AT was enriched and isolated from uranium-contaminated aquifer sediment by its ability to grow under anaerobic conditions via the oxidation of lactate coupled to the reduction of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) to anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AHQDS). Lactate was oxidized incompletely to acetate and carbon dioxide according to the reaction CH3CHOHCOO- + 2AQDS+H2O → CH3 COO- + 2AHQDS+CO2. Additional electron donors utilized included formate, ethanol, butanol, butyrate, malate and pyruvate. Lactate also supported growth with Fe(III) citrate, Mn(IV) oxide, humic substances, elemental sulfur, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate, trichloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene serving as the electron acceptor. Growth was not observed with sulfate, sulfite, nitrate or fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. The temperature optimum for growth was 30 °C, but growth was also observed at 20 and 37 °C. The pH optimum was approximately 7.0. The 16S rDNA sequence of strain 853-15AT suggested that it was most closely related to Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans and closely related to Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans and Desulfitobacterium frappieri. The phylogenetic and physiological properties exhibited by strain 853-15AT (= ATCC BAA-636T) place it within the genus Desulfitobacterium as the type strain of a novel species, Desulfitobacterium metallireducens sp. nov.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of long-term application of different organic fertilizers (sewage sludge, farmyard manure, compost) as compared to mineral fertilizer on the structure of the soil organic matter. Capillary electrophoresis was employed for the quantification of monosaccharides and phenolic compounds, whereas NMR and FT-IR were used for the overall characterization of the soils organic matter. Application of farmyard manure results in a higher content of organic matter derived from angiosperms, suggested by the higher levels of syringic and vanillic phenols. Spectroscopic studies show an increase of lignin and lignin-like products in the organic matter of the soil, which may be derived from the cereal straw supplied with farmyard manure. According to spectroscopic analysis, 13C CPMAS-NMR and FT-IR spectra, higher contents of methylene groups (- CH2) from proteins and protein-like compounds, as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, were found in the soil supplied with compost. The monosaccharide (rhamnose, xylose, glucose, mannose, arabinose, fucose and galactose) content was not significantly influenced by the different organic fertilizers, suggesting that the type of amendment used does not affect any of these six studied monomers. Comparing the three organic amendments the most significant differences were observed after long-term application of farmyard manure, with an increase in lignin and lignin-like products in the soil organic matter, and compost, which appears to contribute to an increase of protein and protein-like, as well as carbohydrates content on soil organic matter. The knowledge of such changes can be essential to understand the sorption and bioavailability of pollutants, as well as establish/unestablish ways to recycling organic residues as organic fertilizers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The residues of dieldrin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), internationally-banned agricultural insecticides, continue to exceed government guidelines in some surface soils 30 years after use. Little is known regarding the soil factors and microbial community dynamics associated with the in-situ biodegradation of these organochlorine chemicals. We hypothesised that soil organic matter, a key factor affecting microbial biomass and diversity, affects the biodegradation and total loss of the pollutants 30 years after use. We sampled 12 contaminated paddocks with residue concentrations monitoring data since 1988 that represent two different agricultural surface-soils. The total loss and current concentrations of the residues was correlated with soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass carbon, microbial community diversity indices and microbial community abundance. Current dieldrin and DDT residue concentrations were positively correlated with soil organic matter and clay contents. However, key indicators for loss of residues after 23–30 years were low carbon-to‑nitrogen ratios, high microbial-C-to-total-C ratios and high fungal community evenness. The results support the composition of soil organic matter as an important factor affecting degradation of organochlorines and that co-metabolism of dieldrin and DDT could be enhanced by manipulating the composition of soil organic matter to cater for a broad diversity of microbial function.},

abstract = {Successful remediation of soils co-contaminated with organics and metals may require a combination of technologies. This research addresses the organic component within co-contaminated sites. It is well known that metal contaminants in soil can partially or completely inhibit normal helerotrophic microbial activity and hence prevent in situ biodegradation of organics. Previous work has shown that a rhamnolipid biosurfactant can complex metals such as lead and cadmium. It has also been demonstrated, in pure culture, that rhamnolipid can mitigate metal inhibition during the degradation of naphthalene. The goal of this study was to investigate whether rhamnolipid could reduce the toxicity of a model metal, cadmium, to indigenous soil populations in two different soils, Brazito and Gila, during the mineralization of phenanthrene. Results show that cadmium inhibited phenanthrene mineralization in both soils at bioavailable cadmium concentrations as low as 27 $\mu$M. This inhibition was reduced by the addition of rhamnolipid. Since rhamnolipid is degraded by soil populations, a rhamnolipid pulsing strategy was used to maintain a constant level of rhamnolipid in the system. Using this strategy, phenanthrene mineralization levels comparable to the control (0 mM Cd/0 mM rhamnolipid) were achieved in the presence of toxic cadmium concentrations. This research demonstrates that pulsed application of rhamnolipid may allow bioremedialion of organic contaminants in sites that are co-contaminated with organics and metals.},

abstract = {During the last two decades, extensive research has explored the catalytic effects of different organic molecules with redox mediating properties on the anaerobic (bio)transformation of a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds. The accumulated evidence points at a major role of electron shuttles in the redox conversion of several distinct contaminants, both by chemical and biological mechanisms. Many microorganisms are capable of reducing redox mediators linked to the anaerobic oxidation of organic and inorganic substrates. Electron shuttles can also be chemically reduced by electron donors commonly found in anaerobic environments (e.g. sulfide and ferrous iron). Reduced electron shuttles can transfer electrons to several distinct electron-withdrawing compounds, such as azo dyes, polyhalogenated compounds, nitroaromatics and oxidized metalloids, among others. Moreover, reduced molecules with redox properties can support the microbial reduction of electron acceptors, such as nitrate, arsenate and perchlorate. The aim of this review paper is to summarize the results of reductive (bio)transformation processes catalyzed by electron shuttles and to indicate which aspects should be further investigated to enhance the applicability of redox mediators on the (bio)transformation of contaminants. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It has been frequently cited as a pristine place, but it has a highly diverse microbial community that is continually seeded by nonindigenous microorganisms. In addition to the intromission of alien microorganisms, global warming strongly affects microbial Antarctic communities, changing the genes (qualitatively and quantitatively) potentially available for horizontal gene transfer. Several mobile genetic elements have been described in Antarctic bacteria (including plasmids, transposons, integrons, and genomic islands), and the data support that they are actively involved in bacterial evolution in the Antarctic environment. In addition, this environment is a genomic source for the identification of novel molecules, and many investigators have used culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches to identify cold-adapted proteins. Some of them are described in this review. We also describe studies for the design of new recombinant technologies for the production of difficult proteins.},

abstract = {The flow of new and native plant-derived C in the rhizosphere of an agricultural field during one growing season was tracked, the ratios in different soil C pools were quantified, and the residence times ($\tau$s) were estimated. For this the natural differences in 13C abundances of: (1) C4 soil (with a history of C4 plant, Miscanthus sinensis, cultivation), (2) C3 soil (history of C3 plant cultivation), and (3) C4/3 soil (C4 soil, planted with a C3 plant, Triticum aestivum) were used. Total amounts and $\delta$13C values of total soil C, non-hydrolysable C, light fraction C, water-soluble C, microbial biomass C, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were determined. Using the $\delta$13C values of soil C in a mixing and a 1-box model enabled the quantification of relative contributions of C 3 plant and C4 plant C to the total amount of the respective C pools in the C4/3 soil and their $\tau$s. Compared to early spring (March), the percentage of C3 plant C increased in all pools in June and August, showing the addition of new C to the different soil C fractions. In August the contribution of new C to microbial biomass C and water-soluble C reached 64 and 89{\%}, respectively. The $\tau$s of these pools were 115 and 147 days. The $\delta$13C values of the dominant soil PLFA, 18:1$\omega$7c, cy19:0, 18:1$\omega$9c, 16:0, and 10Me16:0, showed wide ranges (-35.1 to -13.0‰) suggesting that the microbial community utilized different pools as C sources during the season. The $\delta$13C values of PLFA, therefore, enabled the analysis of the metabolically active populations. The majority of $\delta$13C values of PLFA from the C4/3 soil were closely related to those of PLFA from the C 3 soil when T. aestivum biomass contributions to the soil were high in June and August. Specific populations reacted differently to changes in environmental conditions and supplies of C sources, which reflect the high functional diversity of soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time-to-event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R 2 , and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox-Snell R 2 , which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.},

Such tests can, however, be very poor for small and moderate sample sizes. The pbkrtest package implements two alternatives to such approximate ?2 tests: The package implements (1) a Kenward-Roger approximation for performing F tests for reduction of the mean structure and (2) parametric bootstrap methods for achieving the same goal. The implementation is focused on linear mixed models with independent residual errors. In addition to describing the methods and aspects of their implementation, the paper also contains several examples and a comparison of the various methods.},

Hence, there is a need for efficient algorithms and scalable implementations thereof for analysing such data. We present genesis, a library for working with phylogenetic data, and gappa, an accompanying command line tool for conducting typical analyses on such data. While our tools primarily target phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic placements, they also offer a plethora of functions for handling genetic sequences, taxonomies, and other relevant data types. The tools aim at improved usability at the production stage (conducting data analyses) as well as the development stage (rapid prototyping): The modular interface of genesis simplifies numerous standard high-level tasks and analyses, while allowing for low-level customization at the same time. Our implementation relies on modern, multi-threaded C++11, and is substantially more computationally efficient than analogous tools.

abstract = {Cultivation affects soil organic matter and its fractions. Fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) make up an important part of soil organic matter, and their binding capacity influences heavy metal behaviour in soil. This research studied changes in soil organic components and the distribution of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in HA and FA affected by long-term cultivation in black soils. Uncultivated sites and their adjacent cultivated sites (18, 50, and 200 years) were selected. Alkaline sodium hydroxide/pyrophosphate extraction of humic substances and precipitation of HA by acidification were used to separate the HA and FA fractions. Concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in HA and FA were determined. The content of soil organic carbon (C) had decreased by 30{\%} after 200 years of cultivation. Cultivation led to a moderate decrease (38{\%}) in HA and a minor decrease (7{\%}) in FA. The CHA/CFA ratio, which is a humification parameter, decreased from 2.05 in the uncultivated soil to 1.38 in the soil cultivated for 200 years, indicating a lower degree of humification of organic matter in cultivated soils. Of the Na4P2O 7+NaOH-extracted Pb and Zn, 47-60{\%} and 63-76{\%}, respectively, was associated with FA, showing that FA has a high affinity for Pb and Zn. Of the Na4P2O7+NaOH-extracted Cu, 55{\%} was in the HA fraction. The share of Cu and Zn in the HA fraction decreased with cultivation time, but cultivation did not bring about a systematic change in Pb distribution in humic substances. The results show that cultivation can decrease the humified C content and metals bound to the HA fraction, and suggest that cultivation may potentially increase the mobility of heavy metals. {\textcopyright} 2012 CSIRO.},

abstract = {In agriculture, water consumption for crop production represents 69{\%} of all water use. Precision irrigation systems based on available soil water have been developed to improve crop production, reducing water use. Besides the improvements in irrigation management, a better resolution of the optimal water level is required, and revealing the impact of soil matric potential on the soil microbial community may help. Here, the effect of four soil matric potential treatments (-15 kPa, -25 kPa, -30 kPa, and -45 kPa) was evaluated on the soil microbial community across three potato cultivars and two soil types (silt and sand). The results confirmed the soil matric potential with -25 kPa as the optimal irrigation level, which promoted high potato production using the minimal water use. The irrigation levels affected the composition, predicted functionality, and the ecological network of soil bacterial community. Water excess (-15 kPa) and deficit (-30 and -45 kPa) promoted an increase in microbial interaction and alpha-diversity. The results suggested higher Positive/Negative ratio for phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria in optimal irrigation level (-25 kPa) than other irrigation levels. Also, correlation analyses revealed an interesting association between the irrigation levels, potato production, and bacterial functionality, especially in the carbon cycle (fixation and emission). Therefore, this study proposed important associations between the soil bacterial community and water management, focusing on high potato production and minimal water use. The advancement of this knowledge may lead to a more comprehensive assessment of the optimal irrigation levels of others crop production systems. Furthermore, the inclusion of biological mechanisms, especially microbial interactions, in agriculture studies has the potential to contribute to the development of water management practices conducive to both increasing crop yield and maintaining a sustainable soil environment.},

abstract = {Despite advances in physicochemical remediation technologies, in situ bioremediation treatment based on Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) reductive dechlorination activity remains a cornerstone approach to remedy sites impacted with chlorinated ethenes. Selecting the best remedial strategy is challenging due to uncertainties and complexity associated with biological and geochemical factors influencing Dhc activity. Guidelines based on measurable biogeochemical parameters have been proposed, but contemporary efforts fall short of meaningfully integrating the available information. Extensive groundwater monitoring data sets have been collected for decades, but have not been systematically analyzed and used for developing tools to guide decision-making. In the present study, geochemical and microbial data sets collected from 35 wells at five contaminated sites were used to demonstrate that a data mining prediction model using the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm can provide improved predictive understanding of a sites reductive dechlorination potential. The CART model successfully predicted the 3-month-ahead reductive dechlorination potential with 75.8{\%} and 69.5{\%} true positive rate (i.e., sensitivity) for the training set and the test set, respectively. The machine learning algorithm ranked parameters by relative importance for assessing in situ reductive dechlorination potential. The abundance of Dhc 16S rRNA genes, CH4, Fe2+, NO3-, NO2-, and SO42- concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) amounts, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) displayed significant correlations (p {\textless} 0.01) with dechlorination potential, with NO3-, NO2-, and Fe2+ concentrations exhibiting precedence over other parameters. Contrary to prior efforts, the power of data mining approaches lies in the ability to discern synergetic effects between multiple parameters that affect reductive dechlorination activity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that data mining techniques (e.g., machine learning algorithms) effectively utilize groundwater monitoring data to derive predictive understanding of contaminant degradation, and thus have great potential for improving decision-making tools. A major need for realizing the predictive capabilities of data mining approaches is a curated, open-access, up-to-date and comprehensive collection of biogeochemical groundwater monitoring data.},

abstract = {Background. Rieske non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs) are multi-component enzyme systems that are remarkably diverse in bacteria isolated from diverse habitats. Since the first classification in 1990, there has been a need to devise a new classification scheme for these enzymes because many RHOs have been discovered, which do not belong to any group in the previous classification. Here, we present a scheme for classification of RHOs reflecting new sequence information and interactions between RHO enzyme components. Result. We have analyzed a total of 130 RHO enzymes in which 25 well-characterized RHO enzymes were used as standards to test our hypothesis for the proposed classification system. From the sequence analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) components of the standard RHOs, we extracted classification keys that reflect not only the phylogenetic affiliation within each component but also relationship among components. Oxygenase components of standard RHOs were phylogenetically classified into 10 groups with the classification keys derived from ETC components. This phylogenetic classification scheme was converted to a new systematic classification consisting of 5 distinct types. The new classification system was statistically examined to justify its stability. Type I represents two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an FNRC-type reductase. Type II contains other two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an FNRN-type reductase. Type III represents a group of three-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase. Type IV represents another three-component systems that consist of oxygenase, [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and GR-type reductase. Type V represents another different three-component systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase. Conclusion. The new classification system provides the following features. First, the new classification system analyzes RHO enzymes as a whole. RwithSecond, the new classification system is not static but responds dynamically to the growing pool of RHO enzymes. Third, our classification can be applied reliably to the classification of incomplete RHOs. Fourth, the classification has direct applicability to experimental work. Fifth, the system provides new insights into the evolution of RHO systems based on enzyme interaction. {\textcopyright} 2008 Kweon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {A comparison of the fumigation-incubation (FI), fumigation-extraction (FE), release of ninhydrin-positive compounds (NPC), and the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) methods to estimate soil microbial C and N, was made on a range of predominantly sandy, acid soils from Western Australia. The FI method appeared to underestimate microbial C when the C-flush was calculated using a non-fumigated control, whereas microbial C appeared to be overestimated when no correction was applied. Correction for basal respiration using a fumigated soil ‘control' appears suitable for these soils, and gave similar estimates of microbial C to those obtained from the N-flush. The NPC method correlated well with the microbial biomass C and N estimated by the FI methods, but revised relationships: microbial C = 40(NPC) and microbial N = 6.5(NPC) are considered appropriate for fumigations of 24 h. An overall estimate of microbial C and N in each soil was obtained by combining the results from the FI and NPC methods. These combined estimates were used to calibrate the SIR method and to calculate kEC- and kEN-factors for the FE technique. Microbial C ranged from 50 to 421 $\mu$g g−1 and microbial N from 7 to 65 $\mu$g g−1. The SIR method showed reasonable agreement with the other techniques and a revised calibration of Microbial C = 23.5($\mu$1 CO2g−1soil h−1) was obtained for the SIR response on these acid sandy soils when estimated by infra-red gas analysis. The FE methods showed greter variability than the FI or NPC methods, with the kEC and kEN-factors differing between soil types. Overall kEC and kEN-factors were 0.30 ± 0.18 and 0.38 ± 0.14, respectively. The FE and NPC methods appear suitable to estimate microbial C and N in soils from Western Australia provided the appropriate conversion factors are obtained by cross-comparison with other techniques.},

We have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. Our results showed that ITS4-B, when paired with either a 'universal' primer ITS1 or the fungal-specific primer ITS1-F, efficiently amplified DNA from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete DNAs. The results with plants were not as clearcut. The ITS11-F/ITS4-B primer pair produced a small amount of PCR product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the 'universal' ITS primers. However, under conditions where both plant and fungal DNAs were present, the fungal DNA was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant DNA. ITS1-F/ITS4-B preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust-infected tissues. These primers can be used to study the structure of ectomycorrhizal communities or the distribution of rusts on alternate hosts.},

abstract = {Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, has been introduced into agricultural soils via irrigation with treated wastewater and biosolids application. Such contamination is problematic because CBZ is persistent and the risks to ecosystems or human health are unknown. The current study examined CBZ biodegradation in two agricultural soils (soil 1 and 2) and the effects on the soil microbial communities during CBZ exposure. The experimental design involved three CBZ concentrations (50, 500, 5000 ng/g), under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. CBZ concentrations were determined using solid phase extraction and LC MS/MS. The effect of CBZ on the soil microbial community was investigated using high throughput sequencing and a computational approach to predict functional composition of the metagenomes (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states, PICRUSt). The most significant CBZ biodegradation occurred in soil 1 under aerobic conditions. In contrast, CBZ biodegradation was limited under anaerobic conditions in soil 1 and under both conditions in soil 2. For soil 1, several phylotypes were enriched following CBZ degradation compared to the controls, including unclassified Sphingomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, as well as Sphingomonas, Aquicella and Microvirga. These phylotypes are considered putative CBZ degraders as they appear to be benefiting from CBZ biodegradation. PICRUSt revealed that soil 1 contained a greater abundance of xenobiotic degrading genes compared to soil 2, and thus, this analysis method offers a potential valuable approach for predicting CBZ attenuation in soils. PICRUSt analysis also implicated Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae in drug metabolism. Interestingly, numerous phylotypes decreased in abundance following CBZ exposure and these varied with soil type, concentration, duration of exposure, and the availability of oxygen. For three phylotypes (Flavobacterium, 3 genus incertae sedis and unclassified Bacteroidetes), the relative abundance was reduced in both soils, indicating a notable sensitivity to CBZ for these microorganisms.},

abstract = {The flow of new and native plant-derived C in the rhizosphere of an agricultural field during one growing season was tracked, the ratios in different soil C pools were quantified, and the residence times ($\tau$s) were estimated. For this the natural differences in 13C abundances of: (1) C4 soil (with a history of C4 plant, Miscanthus sinensis, cultivation), (2) C3 soil (history of C3 plant cultivation), and (3) C4/3 soil (C4 soil, planted with a C3 plant, Triticum aestivum) were used. Total amounts and $\delta$13C values of total soil C, non-hydrolysable C, light fraction C, water-soluble C, microbial biomass C, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were determined. Using the $\delta$13C values of soil C in a mixing and a 1-box model enabled the quantification of relative contributions of C 3 plant and C4 plant C to the total amount of the respective C pools in the C4/3 soil and their $\tau$s. Compared to early spring (March), the percentage of C3 plant C increased in all pools in June and August, showing the addition of new C to the different soil C fractions. In August the contribution of new C to microbial biomass C and water-soluble C reached 64 and 89{\%}, respectively. The $\tau$s of these pools were 115 and 147 days. The $\delta$13C values of the dominant soil PLFA, 18:1$\omega$7c, cy19:0, 18:1$\omega$9c, 16:0, and 10Me16:0, showed wide ranges (-35.1 to -13.0‰) suggesting that the microbial community utilized different pools as C sources during the season. The $\delta$13C values of PLFA, therefore, enabled the analysis of the metabolically active populations. The majority of $\delta$13C values of PLFA from the C4/3 soil were closely related to those of PLFA from the C 3 soil when T. aestivum biomass contributions to the soil were high in June and August. Specific populations reacted differently to changes in environmental conditions and supplies of C sources, which reflect the high functional diversity of soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {The colonization of land by plants appears to have coincided with the appearance of mycorrhiza-like fungi. Over evolutionary time, fungi have maintained their prominent role in the formation of mycorrhizal associations. In addition, however, they have been able to occupy other terrestrial niches of which the decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter is perhaps the most remarkable. This implies that, in contrast to that of aquatic organic matter decomposition, bacteria have not been able to monopolize decomposition processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The emergence of fungi in terrestrial ecosystems must have had a strong impact on the evolution of terrestrial bacteria. On the one hand, potential decomposition niches, e.g. lignin degradation, have been lost for bacteria, whereas on the other hand the presence of fungi has itself created new bacterial niches. Confrontation between bacteria and fungi is ongoing, and from studying contemporary interactions, we can learn about the impact that fungi presently have, and have had in the past, on the ecology and evolution of terrestrial bacteria. In the first part of this review, the focus is on niche differentiation between soil bacteria and fungi involved in the decomposition of plant-derived organic matter. Bacteria and fungi are seen to compete for simple plant-derived substrates and have developed antagonistic strategies. For more recalcitrant organic substrates, e.g. cellulose and lignin, both competitive and mutualistic strategies appear to have evolved. In the second part of the review, bacterial niches with respect to the utilization of fungal-derived substrates are considered. Here, several lines of development can be recognized, ranging from mutualistic exudate-consuming bacteria that are associated with fungal surfaces to endosymbiotic and mycophagous bacteria. In some cases, there are indications of fungal specific selection in fungus-associated bacteria, and possible mechanisms for such selection are discussed.},

abstract = {1. Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The 'marginal' testing method implemented in the 'vegan' R package and the 'forward' testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the 'marginal' and 'forward' testing methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {The effects of fumigation on organic C extractable by 0.5 M K2SO4 were examined in a contrasting range of soils. EC (the difference between organic C extracted by 0.5 M K2SO4 from fumigated and non-fumigated soil) was about 70{\%} of FC (the flush of CO2-C caused by fumigation during a 10 day incubation), meaned for ten soils. There was a close relationship between microbial biomass C, measured by fumigation-incubation (from the relationship Biomass C = FC/0.45) and EC given by the equation: Biomass C = (2.64 ± 0.060) EC that accounted for 99.2{\%} of the variance in the data. This relationship held over a wide range of soil pH (3.9–8.0). ATP and microbial biomass N concentrations were measured in four of the soils. The (ATP)(EC) ratios were very similar in the four soils, suggesting that both ATP and the organic C rendered decomposable by CHCl3 came from the soil microbial biomass. The C:N ratio of the biomass in a strongly acid (pH 4.2) soil was greater (9.4) than in the three less-acid soils (mean C:N ratio 5.1). We propose that the organic C rendered extractable to 0.5 m K2SO4 after a 24 h CHCl3-fumigation (EC) comes from the cells of the microbial biomass and can be used to estimate soil microbial biomass C in both neutral and acid soils.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of its insecticidal properties and its subsequent widespread use, DDT [2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)1,1,1-trichloroethane] has accumulated in the environment, having a wide range of adverse effects on nontarget species. Due to their hydrophobicity, DDT and other persistent organic pollutants are difficult to remove from contaminated soils, and increasingly so through time as weathering occurs. Phytoremediation is an emerging plant-based technology that may be used to cost-effectively remove or neutralize contaminants in the environment. For some phytoremediation strategies, it must first be possible to translocate hydrophobic chemicals across the root and through the shoot via an aqueous transpiration stream. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five plant varieties (zucchini, tall fescue, alfalfa, rye grass, and pumpkin) to mobilize and translocate DDT. Plants were grown in the greenhouse in soil contaminated with DDT and its metabolites, DDD and DDE (SigmaDDT refers to all of DDT, DDD, and DDE) at two concentrations (high similar to3700 ng/g, and low similar to150 ng/g). All trays were covered with laboratory Parafilm to limit volatilization. Cucurbita pepo species (pumpkin and zucchini) achieved the highest translocation and bioaccumulation factors, and also extracted the highest absolute amounts of SigmaDDT from both the high and low SigmaDDT soils. In the high SigmaDDT soil treatment, pumpkin accumulated 1519 ng of SigmaDDT in the roots and 57 536 ng of SigmaDDT in the shoots, and zucchini accumulated 2043 ng of SigmaDDT in the roots and 35 277 ng of SigmaDDT in the shoots. With the exception of alfalfa and pumpkin, principal component analysis detected no preferential translocation or transformation of SigmaDDT compounds within the plant. The success of the Cucurbita pepo species in this study to extract and translocate such hydrophobic molecules may be related to their high transpiration volume, large above-ground biomass, and composition of root exudates. This suggests potential for their application in phytoremediation.},

abstract = {Microalgae (MA) and purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) have the ability to remove and recover nutrients from digestate (anaerobic digestion effluent) and pre-settled pig manure that can be Utilized as bio-fertilizer and organic fertilizer. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of MA and PPB as organic fertilizers and soil conditioners in relation to plant growth and the soil biological processes involved in nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycling. To this end, a glasshouse experiment was conducted using MA and PPB as bio-fertilizers to grow a common pasture ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) with two destructive harvests (45 and 60 days after emergence). To evaluate the rhizosphere bacterial community, we used barcoded PCR-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes for paired-end sequencing on the Illumina Mi-Seq. Additionally, we used phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis for the detection of putative functional genes associated with N and soil-C cycling. There was a significant increase in plant growth when the soil was amended with PPB, which almost performed as well as the chemical fertilizers. Analysis of the rhizosphere bacteria after the second harvest revealed a greater abundance of Firmicutes than in the first harvest. Members of this phylum have been identified as a biostimulant for plant growth. In contrast, the MA released nutrients more slowly and had a profound effect on N cycling by modulating N mineralization and N retention pathways. Thus, MA could be developed as a slow-release fertilizer with better N retention, which could improve crop performance and soil function, despite nutrient losses from leaching, runoff, and atmospheric emissions. These data indicate that biologically recovered nutrients from waste resources can be effective as a fertilizer, resulting in enhanced C- and N-cycling capacities in the rhizosphere.},

abstract = {Microbial transformations of cyclic hydrocarbons have received much attention during the past three decades. Interest in the degradation of environmental pollutants as well as in applications of microorganisms in the catalysis of chemical reactions has stimulated research in this area. The metabolic pathways of various aromatics, cycloalkanes, and terpenes in different microorganisms have been elucidated, and the genetics of several of these routes have been clarified. The toxicity of these compounds to microorganisms is very important in the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons, but not many researchers have studied the mechanism of this toxic action. In this review, we present general ideas derived from the various reports mentioning toxic effects. Most importantly, lipophilic hydrocarbons accumulate in the membrane lipid bilayer, affecting the structural and functional properties of these membranes. As a result of accumulated hydrocarbon molecules, the membrane loses its integrity, and an increase in permeability to protons and ions has been observed in several instances. Consequently, dissipation of the proton motive force and impairment of intracellular pH homeostasis occur. In addition to the effects of lipophilic compounds on the lipid part of the membrane, proteins embedded in the membrane are affected. The effects on the membrane-embedded proteins probably result to a large extent from changes in the lipid environment; however, direct effects of lipophilic compounds on membrane proteins have also been observed. Finally, the effectiveness of changes in membrane lipid composition, modification of outer membrane lipopolysaccharide, altered cell wall constituents, and active excretion systems in reducing the membrane concentrations of lipophilic compounds is discussed. Also, the adaptations (e.g., increase in lipid ordering, change in lipid/protein ratio) that compensate for the changes in membrane structure are treated.},

In this study, microcosm experiments were established to profile transcriptional activity of As(V)-respiring gene (arrA) and arsenic resistance gene (arsC) as well as the associated bacteria regulated by lactate and/or biochar in anaerobic arsenic-contaminated paddy soils. Chemical analyses revealed that lactate as the organic substrate stimulated microbial reduction of As(V) and Fe(III), which was simultaneously promoted by lactate+biochar, due to biochar's electron shuttle function that facilitates electron transfer from bacteria to As(V)/Fe(III). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that both arrA closely associated with Geobacter ({\textgreater}60{\%}, number of identical sequences/number of the total sequences) and arsC related to Enterobacteriaceae ({\textgreater}99{\%}) were selected by lactate and lactate+biochar. Compared with the lactate microcosms, transcriptions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, Geobacter spp., and Geobacter arrA and arsC genes were increased in the lactate+biochar microcosms, where transcript abundances of Geobacter and Geobacter arrA closely tracked with dissolved As(V) concentrations. Our findings indicated that lactate and biochar in flooded paddy soils can stimulate the active As(V)-respiring bacteria Geobacter species for arsenic reduction and release, which probably increases arsenic bioavailability to rice plants.},

The separation of the phylum from other bacterial taxa is supported by conserved indels in some proteins (e.g., cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 1, CTP synthase and glutamyl-tRNA synthase), by the presence of a large insert in 23S rRNA (Gao and Gupta, 2005; Gao et al., 2006) and by distinctive gene arrangements (Kunisawa, 2007).

abstract = {Microorganisms represent essential components of the global carbon cycle. In addition, it appears that most xenobiotic industrial chemicals can be degraded by microorganisms, either by a combination of cometabolic steps, often yielding partial degradation, or by serving as growth substrate which is accompanied by mineralization of at least part of the molecule. Using a number of examples, including aromatic, chloroaromatic, aliphatic, and chloroaliphatic compounds, I have presented some principles on the degradation. The great influence of some environmental conditions on the degradation, such as the presence or absence of oxygen, the availability of other electron acceptors such as nitrate or sulfate, has been discussed with special emphasis on the type of reactions and the rates of degradation that occur. While aerobic microorganisms use oxidative reactions, the degradation by anaerobic bacteria takes place by reductive types of reactions. The oxidative sequences of aromatic and chloroaromatic compounds in aerobic bacteria yield central intermediates with a diphenolic structure. These compounds are then cleaved by enzymes that use molecular oxygen. In contrast, the anaerobes degrade aromatic compounds by reductive conversions and the central intermediates ready for hydrolytic ring cleavage bear a 1,3-dioxo structure. Aerobic bacteria and fungi, especially ligninolytic ones, were shown to use mechanistically different catabolic pathways and enzymes. The ligninolytic fungi convert oxygen to hydrogen peroxide which is then used for the formation of an aryl cation radical undergoing spontaneous rearrangements and degradation. The broad variety of mechanisms which brings about dechlorination is another important part of this work.Although the diversity of the compounds discussed is very large, the strategy of the organisms used in the degradation includes various analogous reactions. Another important aspect of discussion is the different degree of degradation.While most research is done on organisms that are able to use the respective compound as the growth substrate, i.e., carbon dioxide and biomass result, the cometabolic potential of microorganisms should not be neglected. Cometabolism takes place very much in nature and brings about some modification of a target compound. In general, anoxic microbial degradation seems to be of greater relevance in nature than earlier expected. It is remarkable that some chlorinated compounds such as chlorobenzoates, chlorophenols, or tetrachloroethene may function as a physiologically functional electron acceptor in a type of anaerobic respiration,which leads to non-chlorinated or lower chlorinated products. Since various compounds will not be degraded totally by one type of organism the complementary potential of anaerobic and aerobic populations in combination is thought to be a method to bring about complete mineralization. Finally, the possibility of enhancing the degradative potential of aerobic organisms in the laboratory, i.e., artificial evolution of enzymes and pathways, by different genetic approaches, is discussed.},

A generic mathematical concept for bioavailability is presented taking both factors into account. The combined effect of mass transfer of a substance to the cell and the intrinsic activity of the cell using the substance as primary substrate, is quantified in a bioavailability number (Bn). The concept can easily be extended to secondary substrates. The approach has been applied to explain the observed kinetics of the biotransformation of organic compounds in soil slurries and in percolation columns. The model allowed us to predict threshold concentrations below which no biotransformation is possible. Depending on the environmental system and the chemical involved, predicted threshold concentrations span a range of 11 orders of magnitude from nanograms to grams per liter and match with published experimental data. Mass transfersand not the intrinsic microbial activitysis in most cases the critical factor in bioremediation.},

abstract = {Methylation of a wide range of organic acids with methyl iodide was simply and efficiently performed on anion exchange resins with either supercritical carbon dioxide or acetonitrile as solvents. Analytes including chlorophenoxyacetic acids, pentachlorophenol, and quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid were displaced from the resin in a single step as their methyl esters or ethers in high yield using the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) system, The conversion of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T (solutions of 100 and 35 ppb, respectively) to their methyl esters was complete in 30 min and gave yields of 92{\%} and 99{\%} with coefficients of variation of 10{\%}. Analytes in up to 200 mt of aqueous solution could be trapped on 0.1 g of AG MP-1 anion exchange resin and derivatized and eluted using methyl iodide in supercritical carbon dioxide at 200 bar and 80 degrees C, Less acidic compounds including albendazole, fenbendazole, triclabendazole, and sulfadimidine could also be derivatized on the resin under SFE conditions or in a quick and inexpensive procedure using acetonitrile; however, these compounds gave lower yields and multiple methylated products.},

abstract = {For most problems in science and engineering we can obtain data sets that describe the observed system from various perspectives and record the behavior of its individual components. Heterogeneous data sets can be collectively mined by data fusion. Fusion can focus on a specific target relation and exploit directly associated data together with contextual data and data about system's constraints. In the paper we describe a data fusion approach with penalized matrix tri-factorization (DFMF) that simultaneously factorizes data matrices to reveal hidden associations. The approach can directly consider any data that can be expressed in a matrix, including those from feature-based representations, ontologies, associations and networks. We demonstrate the utility of DFMF for gene function prediction task with eleven different data sources and for prediction of pharmacologic actions by fusing six data sources. Our data fusion algorithm compares favorably to alternative data integration approaches and achieves higher accuracy than can be obtained from any single data source alone.},

abstract = {The extensive use of pesticide causes imbalance in properties of soil, water and air environments due to having problem of natural degradation. Such chemicals create diverse environmental problem via biomagnifications. Currently, microbial degradation is one of the important techniques for amputation and degradation of pesticide from agricultural soils. Some studies have reported that the genetically modified microorganism has ability to degrade specific pesticide but problem is that they cannot introduce in the field because they cause some other environmental problems. Only combined microbial consortia of indigenous and naturally occurring microbes isolated from particular contaminated environment have ability to degrade pesticides at faster rate. The bioaugumentation processes like addition of necessary nutrients or organic matter are required to speed up the rate of degradation of a contaminant by the indigenous microbes. The use of indigenous microbial strains having plant growth activities is ecologically superior over the chemical methods. In this review, we have attempted to discuss the recent challenge of pesticide problem in soil environment and their biodegradation with the help of effective indigenous pesticides degrading microorganisms. Further, we highlighted and explored the molecular mechanism for the pesticide degradation in soil with effective indigenous microbial consortium. This review suggests that the use of pesticide degrading microbial consortia which is an eco-friendly technology may be suitable for the sustainable agriculture production.},

abstract = {In many large-scale conservation or ecological problems where experiments are intractable or unethical, regression methods are used to attempt to gauge the impact of a set of nominally independent variables (X) upon a dependent variable (Y). Workers often want to assert that a given X has a major influence on Y, and so, by using this indirection to infer a probable causal relationship. There are two difficulties apart from the demonstrability issue itself: (1) multiple regression is plagued by collinear relationships in X; and (2) any regression is designed to produce a function that in some way minimizes the overall difference between the observed and ‘predicted' Ys, which does not necessarily equate to determining probable influence in a multivariate setting. Problem (1) may be explored by comparing two avenues, one in which a single ‘best' regression model is sought and the other where all possible regression models are considered contemporaneously. It is suggested that if the two approaches do not agree upon which of the independent variables are likely to be ‘significant', then the deductions must be subject to doubt.},

The separation of the phylum from other bacterial taxa is supported by conserved indels in some proteins (e.g., cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 1, CTP synthase and glutamyl-tRNA synthase), by the presence of a large insert in 23S rRNA (Gao and Gupta, 2005; Gao et al., 2006) and by distinctive gene arrangements (Kunisawa, 2007).

abstract = {Quantifying the content and composition of soil carbon in the laboratory is time-consuming, requires specialised equipment and is therefore expensive. Rapid, simple and low-cost accurate methods of analysis are required to support current interests in carbon accounting. This study was completed to develop national and state-based models capable of predicting soil carbon content and composition by coupling diffuse reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectra with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses. Total, organic and inorganic carbon contents were determined and MIR spectra acquired for 20495 soil samples collected from 4526 locations from soil depths to 1m within Australia's agricultural regions. However, all subsequent MIR/PLSR models were developed using soils only collected from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30cm depth layers. The extent of grinding applied to air-dried soil samples was found to be an important determinant of the variability in acquired MIR spectra. After standardisation of the grinding time, national MIR/PLSR models were developed using an independent test-set validation approach to predict the square-root transformed contents of total, organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen. Laboratory fractionation of soil organic carbon into particulate, humus and resistant forms was completed on 312 soil samples. Reliable national MIR/PLSR models were developed using cross-validation to predict the contents of these soil organic carbon fractions; however, further work is required to enhance the representation of soils with significant contents of inorganic carbon. Regional MIR/PLSR models developed for total, organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen contents were found to produce more reliable and accurate predictions than the national models. The MIR/PLSR approach offers a more rapid and more cost effective method, relative to traditional laboratory methods, to derive estimates of the content and composition of soil carbon and total nitrogen content provided that the soils are well represented by the calibration samples used to build the predictive models. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2013.},

However, the impact of humic substances on the soil microbial community during the biotransformation of organic pollutants is expected to be crucial while remains to be unclear. In this study, the biostimulation of indigenous microbial communities and the consequent effects on anaerobic transformation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by a model humic substance, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), were systematically investigated in a paddy soil. The addition of AQDS was observed to increase the production of HCl-extractable Fe(II) and enhance the PCP transformation rates consequently. The pseudo-first-order rate constants of the PCP transformation showed a positive exponential relationship with the AQDS dosage. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) results indicated the substantial effect of added AQDS on soil microbial community. The enhanced abundance of Geobacter sp. was disclosed to be most critical for accelerated PCP transformation when with AQDS, in which Geobacter sp. functioned for promoting the generation of active Fe(II) and consequently enhancing the PCP transformation rates. The transformation rates of PCP were exponentially correlated with the abundance of Geobacter sp. positively. The findings are expected to improve the understanding of diversity and ubiquity of microorganisms in humic substances-rich soils for accelerating the transformations of soil chlorinated pollutants.},

abstract = {Compositional data (almost all data in geochemistry) are closed data, that is they usually sum up to a constant (e.g. weight percent, wt.{\%}) and carry only relative information. Thus, the covariance structure of compositional data is strongly biased and results of many multivariate techniques become doubtful without a proper transformation of the data. The centred logratio transformation (clr) is often used to open closed data. However the transformed data do not have full rank following a logratio transformation and cannot be used for robust multivariate techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). Here we propose to use the isometric logratio transformation (ilr) instead. However, the ilr transformation has the disadvantage that the resulting new variables are no longer directly interpretable in terms of the originally entered variables. Here we propose a technique how the resulting scores and loadings of a robust PCA on ilr transformed data can be back-transformed and interpreted. The procedure is demonstrated using a real data set from regional geochemistry and compared to results from non-transformed and non-robust versions of PCA. It turns out that the procedure using ilr-transformed data and robust PCA delivers superior results to all other approaches. The examples demonstrate that due to the compositional nature of geochemical data PCA should not be carried out without an appropriate transformation. Furthermore a robust approach is preferable if the dataset contains outliers. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The aim of this review is to consider the bioavailability as a descriptor for the rate and extent of biodegradation and, in an applied sense, bioremediation of organic contaminants in soil. To address this, the review will (i) consider and clarify the numerous definitions of bioavailability and discuss the usefulness of the term 'bioaccessibility'; (ii) relate definition to the microbiological and chemical measurement of organic contaminants' bioavailability in soil, and (iii) explore the mechanisms employed by soil microorganisms to attack organic contaminants in soil. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, knowledge on the assembly of rhizospheric communities in aged-contaminated industrial soils is still limited, especially with regard to transcriptionally active microbiomes and their link to the quality or quantity of carbon sources. We compared the short-term (2–10 days) dynamics of bacterial communities and potential PAH-degrading bacteria in bare or ryegrass-planted aged-contaminated soil spiked with phenanthrene, put in relation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution. Both resident and active bacterial communities (analyzed from DNA and RNA, respectively) showed higher species richness and smaller dispersion between replicates in planted soils. Root development strongly favored the activity of Pseudomonadales within the first 2 days, and of members of Actinobacteria, Caulobacterales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales within 6–10 days. Plants slowed down the dissipation of phenanthrene, while root exudation provided a cocktail of labile substrates that might preferentially fuel microbial growth. Although the abundance of PAH-degrading genes increased in planted soil, their transcription level stayed similar to bare soil. In addition, network analysis revealed that plants induced an early shift in the identity of potential phenanthrene degraders, which might influence PAH dissipation on the long-term.},

Consensus is emerging that microbial materials are an important constituent of stable SOM, and new conceptual and quantitative SOM models are rapidly incorporating this view. However, direct evidence demonstrating that microbial residues account for the chemistry, stability and abundance of SOM is still lacking. Further, emerging models emphasize the stabilization of microbial-derived SOM by abiotic mechanisms, while the effects of microbial physiology on microbial residue production remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct evidence that soil microbes produce chemically diverse, stable SOM. We show that SOM accumulation is driven by distinct microbial communities more so than clay mineralogy, where microbial-derived SOM accumulation is greatest in soils with higher fungal abundances and more efficient microbial biomass production.},

Such data, called compositional data, require special treatment to avoid misleading conclusions. Awareness of the need for caution in analyzing compositional data is growing, including the understanding that correlation is not appropriate for relative data. Recently, researchers have proposed proportionality as a valid alternative to correlation for calculating pairwise association in relative data. Although the question of how to best measure proportionality remains open, we present here a computationally efficient R package that implements three measures of proportionality. In an effort to advance the understanding and application of proportionality analysis, we review the mathematics behind proportionality, demonstrate its application to genomic data, and discuss some ongoing challenges in the analysis of relative abundance data.},

abstract = {The number of studies on priming effects (PE) in soil has strongly increased during the last years. The information regarding real versus apparent PE as well as their mechanisms remains controversial. Based on a meta-analysis of studies published since 1980, we evaluated the intensity, direction, and the reality of PE in dependence on the amount and quality of added primers, the microbial biomass and community structure, enzyme activities, soil pH, and aggregate size. The meta-analysis allowed revealing quantitative relationships between the amounts of added substrates as related to microbial biomass C and induced PE. Additions of easily available organic C up to 15{\%} of microbial biomass C induce a linear increase of extra CO2. When the added amount of easily available organic C is higher than 50{\%} of the microbial biomass C, an exponential decrease of the PE or even a switch to negative values is often observed. A new approach based on the assessment of changes in the production of extracellular enzymes is suggested to distinguish real and apparent PE. To distinguish real and apparent PE, we discuss approaches based on the C budget. The importance of fungi for long-term changes of SOM decomposition is underlined. Priming effects can be linked with microbial community structure only considering changes in functional diversity. We conclude that the PE involves not only one mechanism but a succession of processes partly connected with succession of microbial community and functions. An overview of the dynamics and intensity of these processes as related to microbial biomass changes and C and N availability is presented.},

abstract = {Abstract The CHCl3 fumigation-extraction method for determining soil microbial N involves the extraction of CHCl3-fumigated and CHCl3-unfumigated samples with 0.5 M K2SO4, followed by determination of total N in the extracts. Total N is typically determined by Kjeldahl digestion (TKN) with the inclusion of NO-2 and NO-3 present. The determination of total N by TKN has several procedural constraints such as an initial concentration step, long digestion times, and considerable bumping caused by catalyst salts. In contrast, a persulfate oxidation method (TPN) commonly used for determination of total N in sea- and freshwater samples does not require a concentration step and is much simpler and faster than TKN. The objective of this study was to evaluate and adapt the TPN method to measure total N in 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts for determination of soil microbial biomass N. Studies were conducted to optimize reagent/sample (R/S) ratio and autoclaving time, and to evaluate the effects of C and N concentrations. These studies showed that complete N recovery can be obtained with a R/S ratio of 1 and an autoclaving time of 30 min in extracts containing as much as 250 mg glucose-C L-1 at a C/N ratio of 10:1. A comparison of the optimized TPN method to TKN for extracts of 12 CHCL3-fumigated soils indicated that the methods gave the same N recoveries. The use of the TPN method in 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts should facilitate more rapid and efficient measurements of soil microbial biomass N.},

abstract = {Phytoextraction is influenced by the indigenous soil microbial communities during the remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils. Soil microbial communities can affect plant growth, metal availability and the performance of phytoextraction-assisting inocula. Understanding the basic ecology of indigenous soil communities associated with the phytoextraction process, including the interplay between selective pressures upon the communities, is an important step towards phytoextraction optimization. This study investigated the impact of cadmium (Cd), and the presence of a Cd-accumulating plant, Carpobrotus rossii (Haw.) Schwantes, on the structure of soil-bacterial and fungal communities using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Whilst Cd had no detectable influence upon fungal communities, bacterial communities underwent significant structural changes with no reduction in 16S rRNA copy number. The presence of C. rossii influenced the structure of all communities and increased ITS copy number. Suites of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) changed in abundance in response to either Cd or C. rossii, however we found little evidence to suggest that the two selective pressures were acting synergistically. The Cd-induced turnover in bacterial OTUs suggests that Cd alters competition dynamics within the community. Further work to understand how competition is altered could provide a deeper understanding of the microbiome-plant-environment and aid phytoextraction optimization.},

abstract = {Before being able to implement effective ruminal methane mitigation strategies via feed supplementation, the assessment of side effects on ruminal fermentation and rumen microbial populations is indispensable. In this respect we investigated the effects of monolaurin, a methane-mitigating lipid, on methanogens and important carbohydrate-degrading bacteria present in ruminal fluid of dairy cattle in continuous culture employing the rumen simulation technique. In six experimental runs, each lasting for 10 days, four diets with different carbohydrate composition, based on hay, maize, wheat and a maize-wheat mixture, either remained non-supplemented or were supplemented with monolaurin and incubated in a ruminal-fluid buffer mixture. Incubation liquid samples from days 6 to 10 of incubation were analyzed with relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA genes to assess monolaurin-induced shifts in specific rumen microbial populations in relation to the corresponding non-supplemented diets. Monolaurin completely inhibited Fibrobacter succinogenes in all diets while the response of the other cellulolytic bacteria varied in dependence of the diet. Megasphaera elsdenii remained unaffected by monolaurin in the two diets containing maize, but was slightly stimulated by monolaurin with the wheat and largely with the hay diet. The supply of monolaurin suppressed Methanomicrobiales below the detection limit with all diets, whereas relative 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of Methanobacteriales increased by 7-fold with monolaurin in case of the hay diet. Total Archaea were decreased by up to over 90{\%}, but this was significant only for the wheat containing diets. Thus, monolaurin exerted variable effects mediated by unknown mechanisms on important ruminal microbes involved in carbohydrate degradation, along with its suppression of methane formation. The applicability of monolaurin for methane mitigation in ruminants thus depends on the extent to which adverse effects on carbohydrate-degrading bacteria actually impair the supply of digested carbohydrates to the animal. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous soil pollutants. The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. 13C-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in 13C-SIP incubations compared to 12C-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of 13C-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation.

abstract = {Astonishing as it may seem, one organism's waste is often ideal food for another. Many waste products generated by human activities are routinely degraded by microorganisms under controlled conditions during waste-water treatment. Toxic pollutants resulting from inadvertent releases, such as oil spills, are also consumed by bacteria, the simplest organisms on Earth. Biodegradation of toxic or particularly persistent compounds, however, remains problematic. What has escaped the attention of many is that bacteria exposed to pollutants can adapt to them by mutating or acquiring degradative genes. These bacteria can proliferate in the environment as a result of the selection pressures created by pollutants. The positive outcome of selection pressure is that harmful compounds may eventually be broken down completely through biodegradation. The downside is that biodegradation may require extremely long periods of time. Although the adaptation process has been shown to be reproducible, it remains very difficult to predict.},

This contribution provides an update on the current knowledge on metabolic and phylogenetic diversity of anaerobic microorganisms that are capable of dehalogenating-or completely mineralizing-halogenated hydrocarbons by fermentative, oxidative, or reductive pathways. In particular, research of the past decade has focused on halorespiring anaerobes, which couple the dehalogenation by dedicated enzyme systems to the generation of energy by electron transport-driven phosphorylation. Significant advances in the biochemistry and molecular genetics of degradation pathways have revealed mechanistic and structural similarities between dehalogenating enzymes from phylogenetic ally distinct anaerobes. The availability of two almost complete genome sequences of halorespiring isolates recently enabled comparative and functional genomics approaches, setting the stage for the further exploitation of halorespiring and other anaerobic dehalogenating microbes as dedicated degraders in biological remediation processes.},

The results showed that the degradation half-life of CBD at concentrations of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg obviously increased, but that of CTC at levels of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg decreased with increasing treatment frequency. Soil microbial activity and functional diversity displayed the suppression trend in CBD treatment and the suppression-recovery-stimulation trend in CTC and CBD + CTC treatments, which were consistent with the findings of decreased degradation rate of CBD and increased degradation rate of CTC. 16S amplicon sequencing analysis revealed five potentially dominant CTC-resistant microbial genera including Bacillus, Actinobacillus, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Corynebacterium, which may mainly carry major facilitator superfamily transporter protein, ribosomal protection protein, and other proteins encoded by tetA, tetB, tetC, tetH, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetV, tetW, tetX, tetZ, tet33, and tet39. These five dominant genera may jointly contribute to the elevated bacterial community resistance to CTC. Our findings provided a better understanding of microbial community structure and function changes in repeatedly treated soils with CBD and CTC.},

abstract = {In the medical literature, hundreds of prediction models are being developed to predict health outcomes in individuals. For continuous outcomes, typically a linear regression model is developed to predict an individual's outcome value conditional on values of multiple predictors (covariates). To improve model development and reduce the potential for overfitting, a suitable sample size is required in terms of the number of subjects (n) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) for potential inclusion. We propose that the minimum value of n should meet the following four key criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9; (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the apparent and adjusted R 2 ; (iii) precise estimation (a margin of error ≤ 10{\%} of the true value) of the model's residual standard deviation; and similarly, (iv) precise estimation of the mean predicted outcome value (model intercept). The criteria require prespecification of the user's chosen p and the model's anticipated R 2 as informed by previous studies. The value of n that meets all four criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. In an applied example, a new model to predict lung function in African-American women using 25 predictor parameters requires at least 918 subjects to meet all criteria, corresponding to at least 36.7 subjects per predictor parameter. Even larger sample sizes may be needed to additionally ensure precise estimates of key predictor effects, especially when important categorical predictors have low prevalence in certain categories.},

abstract = {A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.},

We develop a simple model describing the relationships between the first-order decay rate coefficients (k2 and k3, respectively) for holocellulose (C2) and lignin (C3) litter fractions over the full range of LCI values from 0 to an empirical maximum of {\~{}}0.7 (LCImax). We assume that: (1) k2 and k3 are linear functions of LCI; (2) holocellulose degradation (dC2/dt) provides a net energy yield, while lignin decay (dC3/dt) has a net energy cost; and (3) LCImax is the LCI value at which the yield of dC2/dt equals the cost of dC3/dt. This model is consistent with empirical observations of key aspects of litter decay, such as changes in LCI, and can be used to quantify energetic relationships during decomposition, such as the relationship between potential carbon use efficiency (CUE) and litter quality (LCI). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, interactomics are compiled at an ever increasing pace and now form a core part of the fundamental systems biology framework. The integrative analysis of these data that are co jointly measured on the same samples represent analytical challenges to extract and visualise meaningful information. Results: The exploratory statistical approaches ‘regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis' and ‘sparse Partial Least Squares regression' have been recently developed to deal with highly dimensional data, to integrate two types of ‘omics' data and to select relevant information. Using the results of these methods, we propose further graphical developments to generate Clustered Image Map and Relevance Networks to better understand the relationships between ‘omics' data and to better visualise the correlation structure between the different entities. We demonstrate the usefulness of such graphical outputs on several biological data sets. Using Cystoscape and GeneGo to further assess the biological relevance of such graphical tools, we show that the inferred networks are relevant to the system under study. Conclusions: Such graphical outputs are undoubtedly useful to aid the interpretation of these promising integrative analysis tools and will certainly help in addressing fundamental biological questions and understanding systems as a whole.

Water repellent sandy soils in rain-fed agricultural systems limit production and have negative environmental effects associated with leaching and soil erosion. The aim was to determine whether compost and clay amendments in a sandy agricultural soil influenced the rhizosphere microbiome of Trifolium subterraneum under differing water regimes. Soil was amended with compost (2{\%} w/w), clay (5{\%} w/w) and a combination of both, in a glasshouse experiment with well-watered and water-stressed (70 and 35{\%} field capacity) treatments. Ion Torrent 16S rRNA sequencing and Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis of functional gene prediction were used to characterise the rhizosphere bacterial community and its functional component involved in nitrogen (N) cycling and soil carbon (C) degradation. Compost soil treatments increased the relative abundance of copiotrophic bacteria, decreased labile C and increased the abundance of recalcitrant C degrading genes. Predicted N cycling genes increased with the addition of clay (N2 fixation, nitrification, denitrification) and compost + clay (N2 fixation, denitrification) and decreased with compost (for denitrification) amendment. Water stress did not alter the relative abundance of phylum level taxa in the presence of compost, although copiotrophic Actinobacteria increased in relative abundance with addition of clay and with compost + clay. A significant role of compost and clay under water stress in influencing the composition of rhizosphere bacteria and their implications for N cycling and C degradation was demonstrated.},

Soil bacterial communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing technology. After two cycles of annual rice-wheat rotation, compared with CT treatments, NT treatments generally had significantly more bacterial genera and monounsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/STFA), but a decreased gram-positive bacteria/gram-negative bacteria ratio (G + /G). S treatments had significantly more bacterial genera and MUFA/STFA, but had decreased G + /G compared with NS treatments. Multivariate analysis revealed that Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Spingomonas, Pseudomonas, Dyella, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Arcicella and Bacillus were correlated with SOC, and cellulolytic bacteria (Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea and Bacillus) and Gemmationas explained 55.3{\%} and 12.4{\%} of the variance in SOC, respectively. Structural equation modeling further indicated that tillage and residue managements affected SOC directly and indirectly through these cellulolytic bacteria and Gemmationas. Our results suggest that Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea, Bacillus and Gemmationas help to regulate SOC sequestration in topsoil under tillage and residue systems.},

abstract = {Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) additions to soils can have large impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling. As the soil microbial community drives SOC fluxes, understanding how PyOM additions affect soil microbes is essential to understanding how PyOM affects SOC. We studied SOC dynamics and surveyed soil bacterial communities after OM additions in a field experiment. We produced and mixed in either 350 °C corn stover PyOM or an equivalent initial amount of dried corn stover to a Typic Fragiudept soil. Stover increased SOC-derived and total CO2 fluxes (up to 6x), and caused rapid and persistent changes in bacterial community composition over 82 days. In contrast, PyOM only temporarily increased total soil CO2 fluxes (up to 2x) and caused fewer changes in bacterial community composition. Of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that increased in response to PyOM additions, 70{\%} also responded to stover additions. These OTUs likely thrive on easily mineralizable carbon (C) that is found both in stover and, to a lesser extent, in PyOM. In contrast, we also identified unique PyOM responders, which may respond to substrates such as polyaromatic C. In particular, members of Gemmatimonadetes tended to increase in relative abundance in response to PyOM but not to fresh organic matter. We identify taxa to target for future investigations of the mechanistic underpinnings of ecological phenomena associated with PyOM additions to soil.},

abstract = {Microbial ecological studies have been remarkably promoted by the high-throughput sequencing approach with explosive information of taxonomy and relative abundance. However, relative abundance does not reflect the quantity of the microbial community and the inter-sample differences among taxa. In this study, we refined and applied an integrated high-throughput absolute abundance quantification (iHAAQ) method to better characterize soil quantitative bacterial community through combining the relative abundance (by high-throughput sequencing) and total bacterial quantities (by quantitative PCR). The proposed iHAAQ method was validated by an internal reference strain EDL933 and a laboratory strain WG5. Application of the iHAAQ method to a soil phenanthrene biodegradation study showed that for some bacterial taxa, the changes of relative and absolute abundances were coincident, while for others the changes were opposite. With the addition of a microbial activity inhibitor (NaN3), the absolute abundances of soil bacterial taxa, including several dominant genera of Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Paenibacillus, decreased significantly, but their relative abundances increased after 28 days of incubation. We conclude that the iHAAQ method can offer more comprehensive information to reflect the dynamics of soil bacterial community with both relative and absolute abundances than the relative abundance from high- throughput sequencing alone.},

abstract = {The increasing input of anthropogenically derived nitrogen (N) to ecosystems raises a crucial question: how does available N modify the decomposer community and thus affects the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). Moreover, N input modifies the priming effect (PE), that is, the effect of fresh organics on the microbial decomposition of SOM. We studied the interactive effects of C and N on SOM mineralization (by natural 13C labelling adding C4-sucrose or C4-maize straw to C3-soil) in relation to microbial growth kinetics and to the activities of five hydrolytic enzymes. This encompasses the groups of parameters governing two mechanisms of priming effects - microbial N mining and stoichiometric decomposition theories. In sole C treatments, positive PE was accompanied by a decrease in specific microbial growth rates, confirming a greater contribution of K-strategists to the decomposition of native SOM. Sucrose addition with N significantly accelerated mineralization of native SOM, whereas mineral N added with plant residues accelerated decomposition of plant residues. This supports the microbial mining theory in terms of N limitation. Sucrose addition with N was accompanied by accelerated microbial growth, increased activities of $\beta$-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase, and decreased activities of xylanase and leucine amino peptidase. This indicated an increased contribution of r-strategists to the PE and to decomposition of cellulose but the decreased hemicellulolytic and proteolytic activities. Thus, the acceleration of the C cycle was primed by exogenous organic C and was controlled by N. This confirms the stoichiometric decomposition theory. Both K- and r-strategists were beneficial for priming effects, with an increasing contribution of K-selected species under N limitation. Thus, the priming phenomenon described in 'microbial N mining' theory can be ascribed to K-strategists. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {This study was performed to reveal the microbial community characteristics in simulated managed aquifer recharge (MAR), a natural water treatment system, under different concentrations and compositions of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and further link these to the biotransformation of emerging trace organic chemicals (TOrCs). Two pairs of soil-column setups were established in the laboratory receiving synthetic feed solutions composed of different peptone/humic acid ratios and concentrations. Higher BDOC concentration resulted in lower microbial community diversity and higher relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria. Decreasing the peptone/humic acid ratio resulted in higher diversity of the community and higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria. The metabolic capabilities of microbiome involved in xenobiotics biodegradation were significantly promoted under lower BDOC concentration and higher humic acid content. Cytochrome P450 genes were also more abundant under these primary substrate conditions. Lower peptone/humic acid ratios also promoted the attenuation of most TOrCs. These results suggest that the primary substrate characterized by a more refractory character could increase the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria, as well as associated cytochrome P450 genes, all of which should play important roles in the biotransformation of TOrCs in this natural treatment system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

Metagenomics-based approaches help in the identification and isolation of new genes from the uncultivable sources and provide insights for future research. There is potential in the elucidation of pathways of degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from environment by the microorganisms. This is possible by means of new/improved microbial species. The behavior of isolated strains and the microorganisms when present in community is altogether different. Therefore, there is a need to develop new technology which will identify the minor component of the microbial community involved in degradation because the minor part might have profound effect on degradation. This is mediated by the biological activity of the microbial system.},

Increased investment into extracellular enzymes estimated using specific potential enzyme activity was associated with reduced growth yield obtained using carbon use efficiency measures from stable isotope tracing. Reduction in growth yield was linked more to carbon than nitrogen acquisition highlighting smaller stoichiometric than energetic constraints on community metabolism in examined soils.},

Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference. We developed a taxonomy to tree approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408 315 sequences. We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency. The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75{\%} of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups. All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download. The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project).

Among 14 isolates, the soil bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa L2-1 showed the highest tolerance to increasing concentrations of the organochlorides and was selected for further studies. Biodegradation was assessed in liquid medium, varying the concentrations of glucose and the presence of rhamnolipids (RL). The best medium for the occurrence of biodegradation of the compounds contained 0.5{\%} glucose, giving approximately 50{\%} yield after three days of incubation. Results showed that the biodegradation rates of the organochlorides by P. aeruginosa L2-1 were greater at low concentrations of glucose and in the presence of rhamnolipids.},

abstract = {ARISA (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) is a commonly used method for microbial community analysis that provides estimates of microbial richness and diversity. Here we investigated the potential biases of ARISA in richness estimation by performing computer simulations using 722 complete genomes. Our simulations based on in silico PCR demonstrated that over 8{\%} of bacterial strains represented by complete genomes will never yield a PCR fragment using ARISA primers, usually because their ribosomal RNA genes are not organized in an operon. Despite the tendency of ARISA to overestimate species richness, a strong linear correlation exists between the observed number of fragments, even after binning, and the actual number of species in the sample. This linearity is fairly robust to the taxon sampling in the database as it is also observed on subsets of the 722 genome database using a jackknife approach. However, this linearity disappears when the species richness is high and binned fragment lengths gradually become saturated. We suggest that for ARISA-based richness estimates, where the number of binned lengths observed ranges between 10 and 116, a correction should be used in order to obtain more accurate "species richness" results comparable to 16S rRNA clone-library data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

A simple modelling framework was developed to investigate how substrate quality and environmental controls over microbial activity regulate microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon and on the size of the microbial biomass. Substrate quality has a positive effect on microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon: higher substrate quality leads to higher ratio of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon. Microbial biomass carbon peaks and then declines as cumulative activity increases. The simulated ratios of soil microbial biomass to soil organic carbon are reasonably consistent with a recently compiled global data set at the biome level. The modelling framework developed in this study offers a simple approach to incorporate microbial contributions to the carbon cycling into Earth system models to simulate carbon-climate feedbacks and explain global patterns of microbial biomass. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS175 May 2014 10.1111/ele.12254 Letter Letters Published 2014.

This contribution provides an update on the current knowledge on metabolic and phylogenetic diversity of anaerobic microorganisms that are capable of dehalogenating-or completely mineralizing-halogenated hydrocarbons by fermentative, oxidative, or reductive pathways. In particular, research of the past decade has focused on halorespiring anaerobes, which couple the dehalogenation by dedicated enzyme systems to the generation of energy by electron transport-driven phosphorylation. Significant advances in the biochemistry and molecular genetics of degradation pathways have revealed mechanistic and structural similarities between dehalogenating enzymes from phylogenetic ally distinct anaerobes. The availability of two almost complete genome sequences of halorespiring isolates recently enabled comparative and functional genomics approaches, setting the stage for the further exploitation of halorespiring and other anaerobic dehalogenating microbes as dedicated degraders in biological remediation processes.},

Highly aged ({\textgreater}70 years), PAH-contaminated soil was incubated under anaerobic conditions by using various anaerobic headspaces, anaerobic headspaces with an oxygen-scavenging complex (titanium(III) citrate) in the aqueous phase, or anaerobic headspaces with electron-acceptor amendments in the aqueous phase. Incubation of soil solely under anaerobic conditions resulted in increased aqueous concentrations of all PAHs tested (fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene). Benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene extractable concentrations were above aqueous solubility, by as much as an order of magnitude for the latter. The degree of solubility increase observed was a function of molecular weight of the PAH regardless of initial soil concentration, suggesting formation of stable PAH-soluble organic matter associations. The soil samples incubated aerobically for 90 d before imposition of anaerobic conditions did not release PAHs to the aqueous phase. Methanogenic organisms and sulfate-reducing bacteria were seen to have the most significant effect on increases in aqueous-phase PAHs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons made more soluble under anaerobic conditions was available to be degraded or transformed under aerobic conditions.},

It was hypothesized that microbial community structure would be similar in soils from the same grassland type, and that grassland vegetation classifications could thus be used as predictors of microbial community structure. Microbial community measurements varied widely according to both site and grassland type, and trends in the effect of grassland improvement differed between sites. These results were consistent with those from similar studies, and indicated that floristic community composition was not a stable predictor of microbial community structure across sites. This may indicate a lack of correlation between grassland plant composition and soil microbial community structure, or that differences in soil chemistry between sites had larger impacts on soil microbial populations than plant-related effects.},

abstract = {Each omics platform is now able to generate a large amount of data. Genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, interactomics are compiled at an ever increasing pace and now form a core part of the fundamental systems biology framework. The integrative analysis of these data that are co jointly measured on the same samples represent analytical challenges to extract and visualise meaningful information. Results: The exploratory statistical approaches ‘regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis' and ‘sparse Partial Least Squares regression' have been recently developed to deal with highly dimensional data, to integrate two types of ‘omics' data and to select relevant information. Using the results of these methods, we propose further graphical developments to generate Clustered Image Map and Relevance Networks to better understand the relationships between ‘omics' data and to better visualise the correlation structure between the different entities. We demonstrate the usefulness of such graphical outputs on several biological data sets. Using Cystoscape and GeneGo to further assess the biological relevance of such graphical tools, we show that the inferred networks are relevant to the system under study. Conclusions: Such graphical outputs are undoubtedly useful to aid the interpretation of these promising integrative analysis tools and will certainly help in addressing fundamental biological questions and understanding systems as a whole. Availability: The methods described in this paper are implemented in the freely available R package mixOmics},

abstract = {Biochar is produced from the pyrolysis of carbon-rich plant- and animal-residues under low oxygen and high temperature conditions and has been increasingly used for its positive role in soil compartmentalization through activities such as carbon sequestration and improving soil quality. Biochar is also considered a unique adsorbent due to its high specific surface area and highly carbonaceous nature. Therefore, soil amendments with small amounts of biochar could result in higher adsorption and, consequently, decrease the bioavailability of contaminants to microbial communities, plants, earthworms, and other organisms in the soil. However, the mechanisms affecting the environmental fate and behavior of organic contaminants, especially pesticides in biochar-amended soil, are not well understood. The purpose of this work is to review the role of biochar in primary processes, such as adsorption–desorption and leaching of pesticides. Biochar has demonstrable effects on the fate and effects of pesticides and has been shown to affect the degradation and bioavailability of pesticides for living organisms. Moreover, some key aspects of agricultural and environmental applications of biochar are highlighted.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate how the relationships between bacterial communities and organic C (SOC) in topsoil (0-5 cm) are affected by tillage practices [conventional intensive tillage (CT) or no-tillage (NT)] and straw-returning methods [crop straw returning (S) or removal (NS)] under a rice-wheat rotation in central China. Soil bacterial communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing technology. After two cycles of annual rice-wheat rotation, compared with CT treatments, NT treatments generally had significantly more bacterial genera and monounsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/STFA), but a decreased gram-positive bacteria/gram-negative bacteria ratio (G + /G). S treatments had significantly more bacterial genera and MUFA/STFA, but had decreased G + /G compared with NS treatments. Multivariate analysis revealed that Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Spingomonas, Pseudomonas, Dyella, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Arcicella and Bacillus were correlated with SOC, and cellulolytic bacteria (Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea and Bacillus) and Gemmationas explained 55.3{\%} and 12.4{\%} of the variance in SOC, respectively. Structural equation modeling further indicated that tillage and residue managements affected SOC directly and indirectly through these cellulolytic bacteria and Gemmationas. Our results suggest that Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea, Bacillus and Gemmationas help to regulate SOC sequestration in topsoil under tillage and residue systems.},

abstract = {Variations in the amplitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 have shown an association with surface air temperature consistent with the hypothesis that warmer temperatures have promoted increases in plant growth during summer and/or plant respiration during winter in the northern high latitudes. Here we present evidence from satellite data that the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation increased from 1981 to 1991 in a manner that is suggestive of an increase in plant growth associated with a lengthening of the active growing season. The regions exhibiting the greatest increase lie between 45°N and 70°N, where marked warming has occurred in the spring time due to an early disappearance of snow. The satellite data are concordant with an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeding 20{\%} since the early 1970s, and an advance of up to seven days in the timing of the drawdown of CO2 in spring and early summer. Thus, both the satellite data and the CO2 record indicate that the global carbon cycle has responded to interannual fluctuations in surface air temperature which, although small at the global scale, are regionally highly significant.},

abstract = {Chemical contamination of natural and agricultural habitats is an increasing global problem and a major threat to sustainability and human health. Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are one major class of contaminant and can undergo microbial degradation, however, no studies have applied system-wide ecogenomic tools to investigate OP degradation or use metagenomics to understand the underlying mechanisms of biodegradation in situ and predict degradation potential. Thus, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the functional genes and genomic potential underpinning degradation and community responses to contamination. Here we address this knowledge gap by performing shotgun sequencing of community DNA from agricultural soils with a history of pesticide usage and profiling shifts in functional genes and microbial taxa abundance. Our results showed two distinct groups of soils defined by differing functional and taxonomic profiles. Degradation assays suggested that these groups corresponded to the organophosphorus degradation potential of soils, with the fastest degrading community being defined by increases in transport and nutrient cycling pathways and enzymes potentially involved in phosphorus metabolism. This was against a backdrop of taxonomic community shifts potentially related to contamination adaptation and reflecting the legacy of exposure. Overall our results highlight the value of using holistic system-wide metagenomic approaches as a tool to predict microbial degradation in the context of the ecology of contaminated habitats.},

abstract = {The degradation characteristics of carbendazim (CBD) and chlortetracycline (CTC) in individual and combined treatments, and dynamics of soil microbial structural and functional diversity as well as their potential relations were studied during three repeated treatments using different concentrations. The results showed that the degradation half-life of CBD at concentrations of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg obviously increased, but that of CTC at levels of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg decreased with increasing treatment frequency. Soil microbial activity and functional diversity displayed the suppression trend in CBD treatment and the suppression-recovery-stimulation trend in CTC and CBD + CTC treatments, which were consistent with the findings of decreased degradation rate of CBD and increased degradation rate of CTC. 16S amplicon sequencing analysis revealed five potentially dominant CTC-resistant microbial genera including Bacillus, Actinobacillus, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Corynebacterium, which may mainly carry major facilitator superfamily transporter protein, ribosomal protection protein, and other proteins encoded by tetA, tetB, tetC, tetH, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetV, tetW, tetX, tetZ, tet33, and tet39. These five dominant genera may jointly contribute to the elevated bacterial community resistance to CTC. Our findings provided a better understanding of microbial community structure and function changes in repeatedly treated soils with CBD and CTC.},

abstract = {Humic acids (HA) are ubiquitous redox-active compounds of natural aquatic and soil systems. Here we studied the potential of HA as reductants for chlorinated aliphatic pollutants. To avoid artifacts potentially involved when studying chemically reduced HA, we prepared electrochemically reduced soil, aquatic and synthetic HA, and anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AHQDS), a model compound for hydroquinone moieties in HA. Both reduced HA and AHQDS reduced hexachloroethane (HCE) at appreciable rates. Some reduction of HCE by HA, however, occurred even before electrochemical reduction of the humic acids. This indicates that a small fraction of reduced moieties in HA persists at oxic conditions for some time. The initial reaction followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, and tetrachloroethylene was the only halogenated product. The relatively small variations in carbonnormalized rate constants, kDOC, found indicate that despite inherent variations in concentration, accessibility, and reactivity of redox-active groups in HA of various origins their overall dechlorination activity is fairly constant. However, HCE transformation rate constants and reducing capacities of different HA did not correlate. Rate constants normalized to both carbon content and reducing capacity of HA clearly indicate that reduced functional groups in different HA exhibit different reactivities. Our results together with the factthat reduced HA can be formed by a variety of microbiological and chemical processes suggest that HA could play a significant role as reductants in the reductive transformation of subsurface contaminants and that such a process could potentially be enhanced at contaminated sites by addition of reducible natural organic matter.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon is important to improve Earth system models' ability to simulate carbon-climate feedbacks. A simple modelling framework was developed to investigate how substrate quality and environmental controls over microbial activity regulate microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon and on the size of the microbial biomass. Substrate quality has a positive effect on microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon: higher substrate quality leads to higher ratio of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon. Microbial biomass carbon peaks and then declines as cumulative activity increases. The simulated ratios of soil microbial biomass to soil organic carbon are reasonably consistent with a recently compiled global data set at the biome level. The modelling framework developed in this study offers a simple approach to incorporate microbial contributions to the carbon cycling into Earth system models to simulate carbon-climate feedbacks and explain global patterns of microbial biomass. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS175 May 2014 10.1111/ele.12254 Letter Letters Published 2014.

abstract = {Delftia sp. JD2 is a chromium-resistant bacterium that reduces Cr(VI) to Cr(III), accumulates Pb(II), produces the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid and siderophores, and increases the plant growth performance of rhizobia in co-inoculation experiments. We aimed to analyze the biotechnological potential of JD2 using a genomic approach. JD2 has a genome of 6.76Mb, with 6,051 predicted protein coding sequences and 93 RNA genes (tRNA and rRNA). The indoleacetamide pathway was identified as responsible for the synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid. The genetic information involved in chromium resistance (the gene cluster, chrBACF,) was found. At least 40 putative genes encoding for TonB-dependent receptors, probably involved in the utilization of siderophores and biopolymers, and genes for the synthesis, maturation, exportation and uptake of pyoverdine, and acquisition of Fe-pyochelin and Fe-enterobactin were also identified. The information also suggests that JD2 produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a carbon reserve polymer commonly used for manufacturing petrochemical free bioplastics. In addition, JD2 may degrade lignin-derived aromatic compounds to 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate, a molecule used in the bio-based polymer industry. Finally, a comparative genomic analysis of JD2, Delftia sp. Cs1-4 and Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 is also discussed. The present work provides insights into the physiology and genetics of a microorganism with many potential uses in biotechnology.},

Microbial activity in soil polluted with DDT, DDE and DDD was increased by the presence of phenol, hexane and toluene as cosubstrates. The consumption of DDT was increased from 23 {\%} in a control (without cosubstrate) to 67, 59 and 56 {\%} in the presence of phenol, hexane and toluene, respectively. DDE was completely removed in all cases, and DDD removal was enhanced from 67 {\%} in the control to {\~{}}86 {\%} with all substrates tested, except for acetic acid and glucose substrates. In the latter cases, DDD removal was either inhibited or unchanged from the control. The optimal amount of added cosubstrate was observed to be between 0. 64 and 2. 6 mg C g-1drysoil. The CO2 produced was higher than the theoretical amount for complete cosubstrate mineralization indicating possible mineralization of DDT and its metabolites. Bacterial communities were evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which indicated that native soil and the untreated control presented a low bacterial diversity. The detected bacteria were related to soil microorganisms and microorganisms with known biodegradative potential. In the presence of toluene a bacterium related to Azoarcus, a genus that includes species capable of growing at the expense of aromatic compounds such as toluene and halobenzoates under denitrifying conditions, was detected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Although more than 58{\%} of the hexoses and pentoses in the soil were recovered in humin, 29-57{\%} of fucose and rhamnose were found in WS-NHS. In the principal component analysis, humin was separated from the other three fractions because of larger proportions of glucose and xylose and smaller proportions of fucose and rhamnose. The HAs contained a larger proportion of arabinose than the other fractions. The monosaccharide composition of the FAs and WS-NHS was similar in each soil type. As deoxyhexoses and pentoses in soil are known to originate mainly from microorganisms and higher plants, respectively, the contribution of microorganism-derived saccharides to total neutral saccharides was considered to be greater in the order of WS-NHS and FAs {\textgreater} HAs {\textgreater} humin. {\textcopyright} 2007 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.},

abstract = {Microbial ecological studies have been remarkably promoted by the high-throughput sequencing approach with explosive information of taxonomy and relative abundance. However, relative abundance does not reflect the quantity of the microbial community and the inter-sample differences among taxa. In this study, we refined and applied an integrated high-throughput absolute abundance quantification (iHAAQ) method to better characterize soil quantitative bacterial community through combining the relative abundance (by high-throughput sequencing) and total bacterial quantities (by quantitative PCR). The proposed iHAAQ method was validated by an internal reference strain EDL933 and a laboratory strain WG5. Application of the iHAAQ method to a soil phenanthrene biodegradation study showed that for some bacterial taxa, the changes of relative and absolute abundances were coincident, while for others the changes were opposite. With the addition of a microbial activity inhibitor (NaN3), the absolute abundances of soil bacterial taxa, including several dominant genera of Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Paenibacillus, decreased significantly, but their relative abundances increased after 28 days of incubation. We conclude that the iHAAQ method can offer more comprehensive information to reflect the dynamics of soil bacterial community with both relative and absolute abundances than the relative abundance from high- throughput sequencing alone.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Recent biotechnology advances allow for multiple types of omics data, such as transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data sets to be integrated. The problem of feature selection has been addressed several times in the context of classification, but needs to be handled in a specific manner when integrating data. In this study, we focus on the integration of two-block data that are measured on the same samples. Our goal is to combine integration and simultaneous variable selection of the two data sets in a one-step procedure using a Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) variant to facilitate the biologists' interpretation. A novel computational methodology called "sparse PLS" is introduced for a predictive analysis to deal with these newly arisen problems. The sparsity of our approach is achieved with a Lasso penalization of the PLS loading vectors when computing the Singular Value Decomposition. Sparse PLS is shown to be effective and biologically meaningful. Comparisons with classical PLS are performed on a simulated data set and on real data sets. On one data set, a thorough biological interpretation of the obtained results is provided. We show that sparse PLS provides a valuable variable selection tool for highly dimensional data sets.

abstract = {Depicted as large polymers by the traditional model, humic substances (HS) tend to be considered resistant to biodegradation. However, HS should be regarded as supramolecular associations of rather small molecules. There is evidence that they can be degraded not only by aerobic but also by anaerobic bacteria. HS presence alters biological transformations of organic pollutants in water and soil. HS, including humin, have a great potential for an application in aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment as well as in bioremediation. Black carbon materials, including char (biochar) and activated carbon (AC), long recognized effective sorbents, have been recently discovered to act as effective redox mediators (RM), which may significantly accelerate degradation of organic pollutants in a way similar to HS. Humic-like coating on the biochar surface has been identified. Explanation of mechanisms and possibility of applications of black carbon materials have only started to be explored. Results of many original and review papers, presented and discussed in this article, show an enormous potential for an interesting, multidisciplinary research as well as for a development of new, green technologies for biological wastewater treatment and bioremediation. Future research areas have been suggested.},

abstract = {The amount of nitrogen stored in soil is related to climate through biotic processes associated with productivity of vegetation and decomposition of organic matter. Other factors, particularly rainfall input, dry deposition input, nitrogen fixation and losses of inorganic nitrogen due to leaching contribute to the variability of nitrogen storage. Here we report that soil nitrogen storage ranges from 0.2 kg m-3 in warm deserts to 2 kg m-3 in rain tundra, with a peak of 1.6 kg m-3 in subtropical wet forests. Soil carbon storage shows a similar pattern. The global nitrogen pool in the surface metre of soil comprises an estimated 9.5 × 1013 kg. Each soil profile examined was classified according to the Holdridge life zone1 in which it was found. Soil carbon/nitrogen ratios range from {\textless}10 in tropical deserts to {\textgreater}20 in cool, wet forests or rain forests. We determined C/N ratios of 15-20 in cool life zones and 10-15 in warm life zones. These results indicate that: (1) Relatively large amounts of soil nitrogen in wet tropical regions are associated with recalcitrant humic materials in an advanced state of decay, with low C/N ratios; (2) the seasonal climate contrast in temperate regions, combined with variable litter quality due to the mix of coniferous and deciduous species, results in moderate carbon and nitrogen storage in soil and variable C/N ratios; and (3) slow decomposition in wet tundra regions results in high carbon and nitrogen storage, with high C/N ratios. {\textcopyright} 1985 Nature Publishing Group.},

Recently, researchers have proposed proportionality as a valid alternative to correlation for calculating pairwise association in relative data. Although the question of how to best measure proportionality remains open, we present here a computationally efficient R package that implements three measures of proportionality. In an effort to advance the understanding and application of proportionality analysis, we review the mathematics behind proportionality, demonstrate its application to genomic data, and discuss some ongoing challenges in the analysis of relative abundance data.},

abstract = {With the predicted climate change, it is expected that the chances of river flooding increase. During flood events, sediments will resuspend and when sediments are polluted, contaminants can be transferred to the surrounding water. In this paper we discuss a numerical intraparticle diffusion model that simulates desorption of dieldrin from a suspension of contaminated porous sediment particles with a well-characterized particle size distribution. The objective of this study was to understand the desorption rate (flux) of dieldrin from a suspension of field-aged sediment at different hydraulic retention times (HRT) of the aqueous phase and to elaborate the effect of particle-size distribution on mass transfer. Desorption kinetics of dieldrin, a persistent organic pollutant (POP), were experimentally measured and described in a separate paper using field-contaminated sediment. A radial diffusion model, accommodating intraparticle reversible sorption kinetics, aqueous phase pore diffusion, and a sink term for bulk aqueous phase refreshment was used to describe the experimental data. We observed rapid equilibrium of contaminants between small particles (10 mu m) and the surrounding water even though the sorption affinity of dieldrin towards organic matter was high. On the contrary, for the larger particles (84 mu m), calculations show that desorption was limited by intraparticle diffusion. Combining small and larger particles in our radial diffusion model resulted in the biphasic desorption behavior often observed even when using a linear isotherm. Flood events will result in an increase of desorption rate of POPs from sediments to the surrounding water. HRT and the particle-size distribution determine the desorption rate. We conclude that nonstationary diffusion within organic matter is the main process of mass transfer. Particle size distributions are very valuable to understand the phenomenology related to mass transfer limitations often described as limited bioavailability and can be used as basis to develop engineering options to limit contaminant mass fluxes into the environment.},

abstract = {In situ anaerobic bioremediation of chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethene (PCE) frequently faces the problem of accumulating toxic, lower chlorinated compounds such as dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). In the present study, the efficacy of the sequential application of electron donors, supporting reductive dechlorination, and of humic acids, acting as extracellular electron shuttles facilitating the anaerobic oxidation of recalcitrant intermediates, was explored in microcosm studies. Upon one initial dose of lactose, supplied in a 1000-fold superstoichiometric electron equivalent ratio, PCE was completely converted into cis-DCE within 35. days. Repeated electron donor additions did not entail exhaustive cis-DCE degradation over incubation time (120. days). Although the electron donor was quickly converted into fatty acids, about 30{\%} of added reducing equivalents were recovered as acetate after four months of operation, indicating the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis. In the next step, the substoichiometric addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, a humic acid model compound, effected the complete removal of the accumulated cis-DCE within 15. days, probably as a result of the participation of the quinone in the biotic or abiotic anaerobic oxidation of cis-DCE. Cis-DCE degradation was not connected to the accumulation of VC, rendering the proposed two-step treatment an efficient and environmentally compliant remedy for anaerobic groundwater bodies contaminated with chlorinated solvents. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled novel insights into microbial niche differentiation, from analyzing environmental samples to understanding human diseases and informing dietary studies. However, identifying the microbial taxa that differentiate these samples can be challenging. These issues stem from the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data (or, more generally, taxon or functional gene data); the changes in the relative abundance of one taxon influence the apparent abundances of the others. Here we acknowledge that inferring properties of individual bacteria is a difficult problem and instead introduce the concept of balances to infer meaningful properties of subcommunities, rather than properties of individual species. We show that balances can yield insights about niche differentiation across multiple microbial environments, including soil environments and lung sputum. These techniques have the potential to reshape how we carry out future ecological analyses aimed at revealing differences in relative taxonomic abundances across different samples. IMPORTANCE By explicitly accounting for the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data through the concept of balances, balance trees yield novel biological insights into niche differentiation.

Micelles of the organic cations Benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium (BDMHDA), or Octadecyltrimethylammonium complexed with the clay-mineral montmorillonite were shown to reduce by 3-6 orders of magnitude the numbers of microorganisms in water as tested in suspension and by filters (20cm in length) packed with the complexes mixed with excess sand (100:1, w/w). Respiration tests demonstrated that E. coli K-12 cells adsorbed to micelle (BDMHDA)-montmorillonite complex lost their viability. Kinetics of filtration of E. coli by two filters in series was adequately simulated by a model which considers convection, adsorption. and desorption. Filtration of E. coli K-12 cells demonstrated that they stayed adsorbed and inactivated by the complex within the column filter without re-growth in water. These results suggest that filters including micelle-montmorillonite composites can secure the safety of drinking water in case of threatening increases in the number of pathogenic microorganisms in the water.},

These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in normal physiological function and disease.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. Evaluating the quality of ecosystems in terms of biological patrimony and functioning is of critical importance in the actual context of intensified human activities. Microbial diversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of ecosystems functioning. However, there is a lack of sensitivity of microbial diversity indicators in the case of moderate and chronic environmental degradation, such as atmospheric deposition of pollutants, agricultural practices, diffuse pollution by wastewater and climate change. As a consequence, there is a need for alternative bioindicators of soils and water quality. Here, we discuss the interest of adopting a more integrative approach based on biotic interaction networks beyond the simple diversity indicators. We review how the various biotic interactions can be integrated in the various microbial networks such as trophic, mutualistic and co-occurrence networks. Then we discuss the efficiency of microbial networks and associated metrics to detect changes in microbial communities. We conclude that the connectance, the number of links and the average degree of co-occurrence networks could vary from 10 to 50{\%} in response to minor perturbations when microbial diversity parameters remain stable. Finally, we analyze studies that aimed at linking microbial networks and activity to evaluate the potential of such networks for providing simple and operational indicators of ecosystem quality and functioning.},

abstract = {The transformation and toxicity of trichlorophenols (TCPs) were studied with a methanogenic enrichment culture derived from sewage sludge. Transformation of TCPs rapidly resumed after heating of the culture at 80°C for 1 h, suggesting that the dechlorinating bacteria are spore-forming anaerobes. 2,4,6-TCP was rapidly dechlorinated via 2,4-dichlorophenol to 4- chlorophenol. During the transformation of 2,4,6-TCP, the most probable number of dechlorinating bacteria increased by 4 orders of magnitude. The most extensive dechlorination was observed in media with complex carbon sources such as yeast extract, peptone, and Casamino Acids, but glucose, galactose, and lactose were also used by the consortium. Experiments using chloramphenicol indicated that the reductive dechlorination of 2,4,6-TCP was regulated by an inducible enzyme system. The highest initial concentration at which dechlorination of 2,4,6-TCP was observed was 400 $\mu$M. 2,4,5-TCP and 3,4,5-TCP were dechlorinated to, respectively, 3,4-dichlorophenol and 3- chlorophenol at initial concentrations of ≤40 $\mu$M. Toxicity for the acid- producing and methanogenic bacteria in the consortium was a function of chemical structure, as the inhibition of these activities increased from 2,4,6-TCP, via 2,4,5-TCP, to 3,4,5-TCP.},

abstract = {The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of genes and proteins are well known for their involvement in pharmacology and toxicology, but also increasingly for their importance and diversity in microbes. The extent of diversity has only recently become apparent with the emergence of data from whole genome sequencing projects and the coming years will reveal even more information on the diversity in microbial eukaryotes. This review seeks to describe the historical development of these studies and to highlight the importance of the genes and proteins. CYPs are deeply involved in the development of strategies for deterrence and attraction as well as detoxification. As such, there is intense interest in pathways of secondary metabolism that include CYPs in oxidative tailoring of antibiotics, sometimes influencing potency as bioactive compounds. Further to this is interest in CYPs in metabolism of xenobiotics for use as carbon sources for microbial growth and as biotransformation agents or in bioremediation. CYPs are also current and potential drug targets; compounds inhibiting CYP are antifungal and anti-protozoan agents, and potentially similar compounds may be useful against some bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis. Of note is the diversity of CYP requirements within an organism, ranging from Escherichia coli that has no CYPs as in many bacteria, to Mycobacterium smegmatis that has 40 representing 1{\%} of coding genes. The basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium surprised all when it was found to contain a hundred or more CYPs. The functional genomic investigation of these orphan CYPs is a major challenge for the future.},

abstract = {Aldrin and dieldrin are extensively used as synthetic pesticides in the agricultural industry, which classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Although these compounds have been prohibited over the past decades in most countries, they are still found in the environment. Many studies have shown the microbial transformation of aldrin to dieldrin as main metabolic product, which has higher toxicity and persistence. However, some microorganisms had ability to convert dieldrin to some metabolic compounds. Furthermore, some studies have also revealed that dieldrin could be mineralized to CO2. In general, degradation of aldrin and dieldrin by fungi is faster than that of bacteria of which degradation pathway is clearly described. The efficiency of degrading microorganisms, introduced into contaminated sites, depends on many factors such as, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources, enzymes, hormones, and light. Some enzymes had been found to be involved in aldrin and dieldrin degradation. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated soils were treated for a period of up to 64 days in situ (HCH dumpsite, Lucknow) and ex situ (University of Delhi) in line with three bioremediation approaches. The first approach, biostimulation, involved addition of ammonium phosphate and molasses, while the second approach, bioaugmentation, involved addition of a microbial consortium consisting of a group of HCH-degrading sphingomonads that were isolated from HCH contaminated sites. The third approach involved a combination of biostimulation and bioaugmentation. The efficiency of the consortium was investigated in laboratory scale experiments, in a pot scale study, and in a full-scale field trial. It turned out that the approach of combining biostimulation and bioaugmentation was most effective in achieving reduction in the levels of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-HCH and that the application of a bacterial consortium as compared to the action of a single HCH-degrading bacterial strain was more successful. Although further degradation of $\beta$- and $\delta$-tetrachlorocyclohexane-1,4-diol, the terminal metabolites of $\beta$- and $\delta$-HCH, respectively, did not occur by the strains comprising the consortium, these metabolites turned out to be less toxic than the parental HCH isomers.},

abstract = {The amount of nitrogen stored in soil is related to climate through biotic processes associated with productivity of vegetation and decomposition of organic matter. Other factors, particularly rainfall input, dry deposition input, nitrogen fixation and losses of inorganic nitrogen due to leaching contribute to the variability of nitrogen storage. Here we report that soil nitrogen storage ranges from 0.2 kg m-3 in warm deserts to 2 kg m-3 in rain tundra, with a peak of 1.6 kg m-3 in subtropical wet forests. Soil carbon storage shows a similar pattern. The global nitrogen pool in the surface metre of soil comprises an estimated 9.5 × 1013 kg. Each soil profile examined was classified according to the Holdridge life zone1 in which it was found. Soil carbon/nitrogen ratios range from {\textless}10 in tropical deserts to {\textgreater}20 in cool, wet forests or rain forests. We determined C/N ratios of 15-20 in cool life zones and 10-15 in warm life zones. These results indicate that: (1) Relatively large amounts of soil nitrogen in wet tropical regions are associated with recalcitrant humic materials in an advanced state of decay, with low C/N ratios; (2) the seasonal climate contrast in temperate regions, combined with variable litter quality due to the mix of coniferous and deciduous species, results in moderate carbon and nitrogen storage in soil and variable C/N ratios; and (3) slow decomposition in wet tundra regions results in high carbon and nitrogen storage, with high C/N ratios. {\textcopyright} 1985 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Biodiversity on the Earth is changing at an unprecedented rate due to a variety of global change factors (GCFs). However, the effects of GCFs on microbial diversity is unclear despite that soil microorganisms play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling. Here, we synthesize 1235 GCF observations worldwide and show that microbial rare species are more sensitive to GCFs than common species, while GCFs do not always lead to a reduction in microbial diversity. GCFs-induced shifts in microbial alpha diversity can be predominately explained by the changed soil pH. In addition, GCF impacts on soil functionality are explained by microbial community structure and biomass rather than the alpha diversity. Altogether, our findings of GCF impacts on microbial diversity are fundamentally different from previous knowledge for well-studied plant and animal communities, and are crucial to policy-making for the conservation of microbial diversity hotspots under global changes.},

abstract = {This report describes the selective isolation of dieldrin- and endrin-degrading bacteria from soil with high degradation activity toward dieldrin and endrin. Several enrichment cultures from the soil were arranged with several structural analogs of dieldrin and endrin as a growth substrate and examined for their degradation activities toward dieldrin and endrin. An enrichment culture with 1,2-epoxycyclohexane (ECH) was found to aerobically degrade dieldrin and endrin. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) indicated that three types of bacteria were predominant in the ECH enrichment culture. Of the three major bacteria, two isolates, Burkholderia sp. strain MED-7 and Cupriavidus sp. strain MED-5, showed high degradation activity toward dieldrin and endrin. The degradation efficiencies of strain MED-7 and MED-5 were 49{\%} and 38{\%} toward dieldrin, respectively, and 51{\%} and 40{\%} toward endrin, respectively, in the presence of ECH for 14 days. These results indicated that ECH was a useful substrate for selective and efficient isolation of dieldrin- and endrin-degrading bacteria from soil containing numerous bacteria. Interestingly, the two isolates could also degrade dieldrin and endrin even in the absence of ECH. These are the first microorganisms demonstrated to grow on dieldrin and endrin as the sole carbon and energy source under aerobic conditions.},

abstract = {We outline an approach to simultaneously assess multilevel microbial diversity patterns utilizing 16S-ITS rDNA clone libraries coupled with automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Sequence data from 512 clones allowed estimation of ARISA fragment lengths associated with bacteria in a coastal marine environment. We matched 92{\%} of ARISA peaks (each comprising {\textgreater} 1{\%} total amplified product) with corresponding lengths from clone libraries. These peaks with putative identification accounted for an average of 83{\%} of total amplified community DNA. At 16S rDNA similarities {\textless} 98{\%}, most taxa displayed differences in ARISA fragment lengths {\textgreater} 10 bp, readily detectable and suggesting ARISA resolution is near the 'species' level. Prochlorococcus abundance profiles from ARISA were strongly correlated (r (2) = 0.86) to Prochlorococcus cell counts, indicating ARISA data are roughly proportional to actual cell abundance within a defined taxon. Analysis of ARISA profiles for 42 months elucidated patterns of microbial presence and abundance providing insights into community shifts and ecological niches for specific organisms, including a coupling of ecological patterns for taxa within the Prochlorococcus, the Gamma Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Clade-specific ARISA protocols were developed for the SAR11 and marine cyanobacteria to resolve ambiguous identifications and to perform focused studies. 16S-ITS data allowed high-resolution identification of organisms by ITS sequence analysis, and examination of microdiversity.},

abstract = {Marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing have profoundly expanded our ability to measure biological communities. But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased towards detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues towards truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.},

@article{Flamholz2013,
abstract = {Contrary to the textbook portrayal of glycolysis as a single pathway conserved across all domains of life, not all sugar-consuming organisms use the canonical Embden - Meyerhoff - Parnass (EMP) glycolytic pathway. Prokaryotic glucose metabolism is particularly diverse, including several alternative glycolytic pathways, the most common of which is the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The prevalence of the ED pathway is puzzling as it produces only one ATP per glucose - half as much as the EMP pathway. We argue that the diversity of prokaryotic glucose metabolism may reflect a tradeoff between a pathway's energy (ATP) yield and the amount of enzymatic protein required to catalyze pathway flux. We introduce methods for analyzing pathways in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics and show that the ED pathway is expected to require several-fold less enzymatic protein to achieve the same glucose conversion rate as the EMP pathway. Through genomic analysis, we further show that prokaryotes use different glycolytic pathways depending on their energy supply. Specifically, energy-deprived anaerobes over-whelmingly rely upon the higher ATP yield of the EMP pathway, whereas the ED pathway is common among facultative anaerobes and even more common among aerobes. In addition to demonstrating how protein costs can explain the use of alternative metabolic strategies, this study illustrates a direct connection between an organism's environment and the thermodynamic and biochemical properties of the metabolic pathways it employs.},

abstract = {The transformation and toxicity of trichlorophenols (TCPs) were studied with a methanogenic enrichment culture derived from sewage sludge. Transformation of TCPs rapidly resumed after heating of the culture at 80°C for 1 h, suggesting that the dechlorinating bacteria are spore-forming anaerobes. 2,4,6-TCP was rapidly dechlorinated via 2,4-dichlorophenol to 4- chlorophenol. During the transformation of 2,4,6-TCP, the most probable number of dechlorinating bacteria increased by 4 orders of magnitude. The most extensive dechlorination was observed in media with complex carbon sources such as yeast extract, peptone, and Casamino Acids, but glucose, galactose, and lactose were also used by the consortium. Experiments using chloramphenicol indicated that the reductive dechlorination of 2,4,6-TCP was regulated by an inducible enzyme system. The highest initial concentration at which dechlorination of 2,4,6-TCP was observed was 400 $\mu$M. 2,4,5-TCP and 3,4,5-TCP were dechlorinated to, respectively, 3,4-dichlorophenol and 3- chlorophenol at initial concentrations of ≤40 $\mu$M. Toxicity for the acid- producing and methanogenic bacteria in the consortium was a function of chemical structure, as the inhibition of these activities increased from 2,4,6-TCP, via 2,4,5-TCP, to 3,4,5-TCP.},

Interpretation of these PD-dissimilarities at the feature level explains the framework's success in producing ordinations revealing environmental gradients. An example gradients space using PD-dissimilarities illustrates how evolutionary features form unimodal response patterns to gradients.

Moreover, eCO(2) increased the concentration of soluble organic carbon in the rhizosphere of white lupin but not wheat.

abstract = {A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.},

abstract = {Geometry in the simplex has been developed in the last 15 years mainly based on the contributions due to J. Aitchison. The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

abstract = {The Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathways are largely conserved across glycolytic species in nature. Is this a coincidence, convergent evolution or there exists a driving force towards either of the two pathway designs? We addressed this question by first employing a variant of the optStoic algorithm to exhaustively identify over 11,916 possible routes between glucose and pyruvate at different pre-determined stoichiometric yields of ATP. Subsequently, we analyzed the thermodynamic feasibility of all the pathways at physiological metabolite concentrations and quantified the protein cost of the feasible solutions. Pareto optimality analysis between energy efficiency and protein cost reveals that the naturally evolved ED and EMP pathways are indeed among the most protein cost-efficient pathways in their respective ATP yield categories and remain thermodynamically feasible across a wide range of ATP/ADP ratios and pathway intermediate metabolite concentration ranges. In contrast, pathways with higher ATP yield ({\textgreater}2) while feasible, are bound within stringent and often extreme operability ranges of cofactor and intermediate metabolite concentrations. The preponderance of EMP and ED is thus consistent with not only optimally balancing energy yield vs. enzyme cost but also with ensuring operability for wide metabolite concentration ranges and ATP/ADP ratios.},

In this paper we argue why standard transformations for compositional data are not suitable for computing correlations, and why the use of raw or log-transformed data is neither meaningful. As a solution, a procedure based on balances is outlined, leading to sensible correlation measures. The construction of the balances is demonstrated using a real data example from geochemistry. It is shown that the considered correlation measures are invariant with respect to the choice of the binary partitions forming the balances. Robust counterparts to the classical, non-robust correlation measures are introduced and applied. By using appropriate graphical representations, it is shown how the resulting correlation coefficients can be interpreted. {\textcopyright} International Association for Mathematical Geosciences 2009.},

abstract = {Background and aims Plants grown under elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) demand more nitrogen from soil and invest more labile carbon (C) compounds into below-ground. This would potentially affect microbial decomposition of soil organic C (SOC) in the rhizosphere- namely rhizosphere priming effect (RPE). This study aims to reveal how eCO(2) and nitrogen (N) supply affect the RPEs under wheat and white lupin. Methods Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L. cv. Kiev) were grown at two N addition rates under ambient CO2 (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and eCO(2) (800 mu mol mol(-1)) for 32 and 52 days in a C4 soil. Rhizosphere priming of SOC was quantified using the stable C-13 isotopic tracing technique. Results Relative to adequate N supply, low N increased the RPEs under both species at Day 32, but decreased the RPEs under wheat while had no effect on RPE under white lupin at Day 52. Elevated CO2 increased the RPE except that under wheat at Day 52. Conclusions Low N availability in soil increased the RPE probably via stimulated microbial N mining while eCO(2) and severe N limitation synergistically decreased the RPE under wheat but not under N-2-fixing white lupin.},

Uruguay has an indigenous alfalfa-nodulating rhizobial population, 10{\%} of which is tolerant to acidic conditions. Although some genotypes were found repeatedly, PCR analysis of the MAT isolates suggests that considerable diversity is present. In addition, we provide evidence that strains from acid soils are not necessarily acid-tolerant. Effectiveness performance studies showed that Medicago species differ not only in their ability to achieve nodulation when growing on acidic soil, but also that distinct genotypes of alfalfa have different abilities to achieve nodulation. Symbiotic analysis of the isolates carried out in pots confirms that they have the potential to improve the growth of alfalfa in acidic and neutral soils. We suggest that a population of native alfalfa-nodulating strains found in Uruguayan soils is able to establish alfalfa in acidic soils.},

abstract = {Endrin is persistent organic pollutants that contaminate soil in many parts of the world. In this study, endrin was used as the substrate for a degradation experiment with the white rot fungi of the genus Phlebia. The results of tolerance test showed that the tolerance level of Phlebia acanthocystis and Phlebia brevispora to endrin was higher than that of other fungi, and the tolerance coefficient of both strains to 1.0 mg/L endrin exceeded 0.9 in solid PDA medium. P. acanthocystis and P. brevispora could degrade endrin efficiently in pure culture, especially P. acanthocystis had the highest degradability of more than 80{\%} after 20 d incubation. Compared with low-nitrogen medium, PDB medium is more suitable for the biodegradability of two fungi. Several hydroxylated products such as 8-hydroxyendrin and two monohydroxyendrin were detected, indicating that endrin was initially branched to different monohydroxylated products in fungal degradation. Moreover, a carboxylic acid product was obtained from P. acanthocystis culture, suggesting that the carboxylation reaction occurred in bioconversion of endrin. The fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes play significant role in the in the initial hydroxylation process on endrin degradation. This is the first report that endrin is converted to hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites by microorganisms.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the potential biomineralization of atrazine and identification of atrazine-degrading bacteria in agricultural soils. Different atrazine application histories of soils impacted the kinetics of biomineralization but not the presence of catabolic genes of two atrazine degradative pathways (Trz and Atz). Biomineralization was based on the measurement of 14 CO 2 from [U-ring- 14 C]-atrazine in surface soil (0–7 cm) samples incubated in biometers. Aerobic atrazine biomineralization rate constants (k) varied in the range of 0.004–0.508 d −1 depending on the specific soil sample and glucose amendment. The corresponding k-values for anaerobic biometers ± nitrate, ferrihydrite or sulfate were 0.002–0.360 d −1 . Glucose enhancement of atrazine biomineralization was not consistent. Aerobic enrichments from soil samples and in-situ incubated BioSep beads yielded mixed cultures, four of which were characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplification, cloning and sequencing. Twelve pure cultures were isolated from enrichments and they were primarily Arthrobacter spp. (10/12). The presence of eight atrazine catabolic genes representing two degradative pathways was investigated in seven bacterial isolates by PCR amplification and sequencing. Several combinations of atrazine catabolic genes were detected; each contained at least atzBC. A complete set of genes for the Atz pathway was not found among the isolates. Our data indicate that atrazine metabolism involves multiple microorganisms and cooperative pathways diverging from atrazine metabolites.},

abstract = {Marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing have profoundly expanded our ability to measure biological communities. But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased towards detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues towards truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {The nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer ITS region is widely used as a DNA metabarcoding marker to characterize the diversity and composition of fungal communities. In amplicon pyrosequencing studies of fungal diversity, one of the spacers ITS1 or ITS2 of the ITS region is normally used. In this methodological study we evaluate the usability of ITS1 vs. ITS2 as a DNA metabarcoding marker for fungi. We analyse three data sets: two comprising ITS1 and ITS2 sequences of known taxonomic affiliations and a third comprising ITS1 and ITS2 environmental amplicon pyrosequencing data. Clustering analyses of sequences with known taxonomy using the bioinformatics pipeline ClustEx revealed that a 97{\%} similarity cut-off represent a reasonable threshold for estimating the number of known species in the data sets for both ITS1 and ITS2. However, no single threshold value worked well for all fungi at the same time within the curated UNITE database, and we found that the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) concept is not easily translated into the level of species because many species are distributed over several clusters. Clustering analyses of the 134 692 ITS1 and ITS2 pyrosequences using a 97{\%} similarity cut-off revealed a high similarity between the two data sets when it comes to taxonomic coverage. Although some groups are under- or unrepresented in the two data sets due to, e.g. primer mismatches, our results indicate that ITS1 and ITS2 to a large extent yield similar results when used as DNA metabarcodes for fungi. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Extensive systems of animal husbandry (e.g., meat and dairy cattle, sheep, goats, and so on) are mainly based on the direct grazing of grasslands, pastures, fodder crops, and crop residues by livestock. Grazing effects on soil properties of forage production systems follow direct and indirect pathways. Direct effects relate to animal trampling and excretion, while indirect effects are mediated by changes in vegetation structure and function. Figure 20|1 shows a simplified model of a grazing system, integrating both direct and indirect effects of livestock on soil physi-cal properties, as proposed by Greenwood and McKenzie (2001). Grazing animals affect soil and vegetation properties through the action of treading, defolia-tion, and excretal returns. This may result in soil compaction and/or poaching damage to the pasture, which may recover as a function of the effectiveness of abiotic (e.g., wetting and drying cycles) or biotic (e.g., roots and worms activity) mechanisms of structural resilience. In addi-tion, defoliation and excretal returns impact carbon and nutrient cycling in soil, which involve particular responses by soil organisms. Soil pores are the habitat for microbes and meso-and microfauna (Young and Ritz, 2005), which in turn are responsible for biotic mechanisms of soil structural resilience. In this chapter, we review the various effects of grazing on soil physical properties, carbon, and nutrient cycling in forage production systems. Where possible, we also discuss some management implications focusing on possible ways of minimizing negative graz-ing effects as well as recovering desirable soil properties for sustainable production. Several review articles have been published over the last decades on the soil physical impacts of grazing (e.g., Gifford and Hawkins, 1978; Willatt and Pullar, 1983; Greenwood and McKenzie, 2001; Drewry, 2006), and most of their main conclusions are summarized in this section. Grazing impacts on soil physical properties are caused by defoliation and treading. Both actions cannot},

abstract = {Aims We aim to construct a comprehensive global database of litter decomposition rate (k value) estimated by surface floor litterbags, and investigate the direct and indirect effects of impact factors such as geographic factors (latitude and altitude), climatic factors (mean annual tempePlrature, MAT; mean annual precipitation, MAP) and litter quality factors (the contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and C:N ratio, lignin:N ratio) on litter decomposition. Methods We compiled a large data set of litter decomposition rates (k values) from 110 research sites and conducted simple, multiple regression and path analyses to explore the relationship between the k values and impact factors at the global scale. Important findings The k values tended to decrease with latitude (LAT) and lignin content (LIGN) of litter but increased with temperature, precipitation and nutrient concentrations at the large spatial scale. Single factor such as climate, litter quality and geographic variable could not explain litter decomposition rates well. However, the combination of total nutrient (TN) elements and C:N accounted for 70.2{\%} of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. The combination of LAT, MAT, C:N and TN accounted for 87.54{\%} of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. These results indicate that litter quality is the most important direct regulator of litter decomposition at the global scale. This data synthesis revealed significant relationships between litter decomposition rates and the combination of climatic factor (MAT) and litter quality (C:N, TN). The global-scale empirical relationships developed here are useful for a better understanding and modeling of the effects of litter quality and climate factors on litter decompsotion rates.},

Microbial activity in soil polluted with DDT, DDE and DDD was increased by the presence of phenol, hexane and toluene as cosubstrates. The consumption of DDT was increased from 23 {\%} in a control (without cosubstrate) to 67, 59 and 56 {\%} in the presence of phenol, hexane and toluene, respectively. DDE was completely removed in all cases, and DDD removal was enhanced from 67 {\%} in the control to {\~{}}86 {\%} with all substrates tested, except for acetic acid and glucose substrates. In the latter cases, DDD removal was either inhibited or unchanged from the control. The optimal amount of added cosubstrate was observed to be between 0. 64 and 2. 6 mg C g-1drysoil. The CO2 produced was higher than the theoretical amount for complete cosubstrate mineralization indicating possible mineralization of DDT and its metabolites. Bacterial communities were evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which indicated that native soil and the untreated control presented a low bacterial diversity. The detected bacteria were related to soil microorganisms and microorganisms with known biodegradative potential. In the presence of toluene a bacterium related to Azoarcus, a genus that includes species capable of growing at the expense of aromatic compounds such as toluene and halobenzoates under denitrifying conditions, was detected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Soil from Eutrochrept A horizons under long‐term spruce forest (Sf), mixed deciduous forest (Df), permanent grassland (Gp) and arable rotation (Ar) was fractionated according to particle size and analysed for contents of C, N, lignin‐derived phenols and carbohydrates. Whole soil from Sf, Df, Gp and Ar contained 84, 59, 73 and 25 g C kg−1 soil, respectively. For all sites, the C content declined and C/N ratio increased in the order: clay ({\textless}2 $\mu$m), silt (2–20 $\mu$m), sand (20–2000 $\mu$m). Clay and silt were significantly lower in C in Ar than in Sf, Df and Gp, C associated with sand being substantially lower under arable rotation. The yield of lignin‐derived phenols decreased and carboxyl functionality and methoxyl demethylation of lignin derivatives increased with decreasing particle size, indicating a progressive lignin alteration. Whole soil from Sf and Gp was substantially higher in vanillyl (V), syringyl (S) and cinnamyl (C) units (VSC) than soil from Df and Ar. Compared to whole soil, clay was depleted and sand enriched in VSC. Only sand appeared to be affected significantly by land use. Sand from Ar and Df was more enriched in VSC than sand from Gp and Sf. Whole soil carbohydrates decreased in the order: Gp{\textgreater}Ar{\textgreater}Df{\textgreater}Sf. Sand‐ and clay‐sized separates were enriched in carbohydrates compared to silt. Carbohydrates in sand were mainly of plant origin whereas microbially‐derived sugars accounted for a larger proportion in the clay. Compared to Sf, Df and Gp, clay from Ar was enriched and sand depleted in microbial sugars. Lignin and carbohydrate distribution patterns indicate that organic matter was in a more advanced stage of decomposition in the sand separates from forest than from agricultural A horizons. The forest soils also show a higher degree of oxidative changes in lignin associated with clay. In contrast, differences between silt from the four A horizons were small.

abstract = {The development of ‘molecular-omic' tools and computing analysis platforms have greatly enhanced our ability to assess the impacts of agricultural practices and crop management protocols on soil microbial diversity. However, biotic factors are rarely factored into agricultural management models. Today it is possible to identify specific microbiomes and define biotic components that contribute to soil quality. We assessed the bacterial diversity of soils in 51 potato production plots. We describe a strategy for identifying a potato-crop-productivity bacterial species balance index based on amplicon sequence variants. We observed a significant impact of soil texture balances on potato yields; however, the Shannon and Chao1 richness indices and Pielou's evenness index poorly correlated with these yields. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate the portion of the total bacterial microbiome related to potato yield using an integrated species balances index derived from the elements of the bacterial microbiome that positively or negatively correlate with residual potato yields. This innovative strategy based on a microbiome selection procedure greatly enhances our ability to interpret the impact of agricultural practices and cropping system management choices on microbial diversity and potato yield. This strategy provides an additional tool that will aid growers and the broader agricultural sector in their decision-making processes concerning the soil quality and crop productivity.},

An example gradients space using PD-dissimilarities illustrates how evolutionary features form unimodal response patterns to gradients.

abstract = {Molecular fingerprinting techniques offer great promise for analyzing changes in microbial community structure, especially when dealing with large number of samples. However, a serious limitation has been the lack of quantification offered by such techniques since the relative abundances of the identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the original samples are not measured. A quantitative fingerprinting approach designated "qfingerprinting" is proposed here. This method involves serial dilutions of the sample of interest and further systematic fingerprinting of all dilution series. Using the ultimate dilutions for which OTU are still PCR amplifiable and taking into account peak size inaccuracy and peak reproducibility, the relative abundance of each OTU is then simultaneously determined over a scale spanning several orders of magnitude. The approach was illustrated by using a quantitative version of automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), here called qARISA. After validating the concept with a synthetic mixture of known DNA targets, qfingerprinting was applied to well-studied marine sediment samples to examine specific changes in OTU abundance associated with sediment depth. The new strategy represents a major advance for the detailed quantitative description of specific OTUs within complex communities. Further ecological applications of the new strategy are also proposed.},

The method is designed to extract synthetic environmental gradients from ecological data-sets. The gradients are the basis for succinctly describing and visualizing the differential habitat preferences (niches) of taxavia an ordination diagram. Linear multivariate methods for relating two set of variables, such as two-block Partial Least Squares (PLS2), canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, are less suited for this purpose because habitat preferences are often unimodal functions of habitat variables. After pointing out the key assumptions underlying CCA, the paper focuses on the interpretation of CCA ordination diagrams. Subsequently, some advanced uses, such as ranking environmental variables in importance and the statistical testing of effects are illustrated on a typical macroinvertebrate data-set. The paper closes with comparisons with correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, PLS2 and co-inertia analysis. In an appendix a new method, named CCA-PLS, is proposed that combines the strong features of CCA and PLS2.},

abstract = {We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.

Although more than 58{\%} of the hexoses and pentoses in the soil were recovered in humin, 29-57{\%} of fucose and rhamnose were found in WS-NHS. In the principal component analysis, humin was separated from the other three fractions because of larger proportions of glucose and xylose and smaller proportions of fucose and rhamnose. The HAs contained a larger proportion of arabinose than the other fractions. The monosaccharide composition of the FAs and WS-NHS was similar in each soil type. As deoxyhexoses and pentoses in soil are known to originate mainly from microorganisms and higher plants, respectively, the contribution of microorganism-derived saccharides to total neutral saccharides was considered to be greater in the order of WS-NHS and FAs {\textgreater} HAs {\textgreater} humin. {\textcopyright} 2007 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.},

abstract = {The betweenness centrality index is essential in the analysis of social networks, but costly to compute. Currently, the fastest known algorithms require $\Theta$(n3) time and $\Theta$(n2) space, where n is the number of actors in the network. Motivated by the fast-growing need to compute centrality indices on large, yet very sparse, networks, new algorithms for betweenness are introduced in this paper. They require script O sign(n + m) space and run in script O sign(nm) and script O sign(nm + n2 log n) time on unweighted and weighted networks, respectively, where m is the number of links. Experimental evidence is provided that this substantially increases the range of networks for which centrality analysis is feasible.},

abstract = {The combination of concurrent soil degradation and restoration scenarios in a long-term experiment with contrasting treatments under steady-state conditions, similar soil texture and climate make the Highfield land-use change experiment at Rothamsted Research unique. We used soil from this experiment to quantify rates of change in organic matter (OM) fractions and soil structural stability (SSS) six years after the management changed. Soil degradation included the conversion of grassland to arable and bare fallow management, while soil restoration comprised introduction of grassland in arable and bare fallow soil. Soils were tested for clay dispersibility measured on two macro-aggregate sizes (DispClay 1–2 mm and DispClay 8–16 mm) and clay-SOM disintegration (DI, the ratio between clay particles retrieved without and with SOM removal). The SSS tests were related to soil organic carbon (SOC), permanganate oxidizable C (POXC) and hot water-extractable C (HWC). The decrease in SOC after termination of grassland was greater than the increase in SOC when introducing grassland. In contrast, it was faster to restore degraded soil than to degrade grassland soil with respect to SSS at macro-aggregate scale. The effect of management changes was more pronounced for 8–16 mm than 1–2 mm aggregates indicating a larger sensitivity towards tillage-induced breakdown of binding agents in larger aggregates. At microscale, SSS depended on SOC content regardless of management. Soil management affected macroscale structural stability beyond what is revealed from measuring changes in OM fractions, underlining the need to include both bonding and binding mechanisms in the interpretation of changes in SSS induced by management.},

abstract = {Bacterial dehalogenases catalyse the cleavage of carbon-halogen bonds, which is a key step in aerobic mineralization pathways of many halogenated compounds that occur as environmental pollutants. There is a broad range of dehalogenases, which can be classified in different protein super-families and have fundamentally different catalytic mechanisms. Identical dehalogenases have repeatedly been detected in organisms that were isolated at different geographical locations, indicating that only a restricted number of sequences are used for a certain dehalogenation reaction in organohalogen-utilizing organisms. At the same time, massive random sequencing of environmental DNA, and microbial genome sequencing projects have shown that there is a large diversity of dehalogenase sequences that is not employed by known catabolic pathways. The corresponding proteins may have novel functions and selectivities that could be valuable for biotransformations in the future. Apparently, traditional enrichment and metagenome approaches explore different segments of sequence space. This is also observed with alkane hydroxylases, a category of proteins that can be detected on basis of conserved sequence motifs and for which a large number of sequences has been found in isolated bacterial cultures and genomic databases. It is likely that ongoing genetic adaptation, with the recruitment of silent sequences into functional catabolic routes and evolution of substrate range by mutations in structural genes, will further enhance the catabolic potential of bacteria toward synthetic organohalogens and ultimately contribute to cleansing the environment of these toxic and recalcitrant chemicals. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO2. Their growth depends on the carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C:N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2012 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Microbial fingerprinting techniques permit the rapid visualization of entire assemblages in single assays, allowing direct comparison of communities in different samples, where the null hypothesis of such analyses is that all samples are the same. The comparison of fingerprints relies upon the precise estimation of all amplified DNA fragment lengths, which correspond to operational taxonomic units (OTU; analogous, but not equal to, a taxon in macroorganism studies). However, computer interpolation of size standards (and consequently OTU size calling) can be imprecise between gel runs, which can lead to imprecise calculation of similarity indices between multiple assemblages. To account for OTU size calling imprecision, all fragments within a range of sizes (a window) can be combined (i.e., "binned") where the window is as wide as the imprecision of OTU size calling. However, artifacts may occur upon binning samples that may cause samples to appear less similar to each other, caused by splitting of OTU between adjacent bin windows. In this work we present an improved binning technique that accounts for OTU size calling imprecision in the comparison of multiple fingerprints. This technique comprises binning all pairwise comparisons in multiple bin window frames, where the starting size of the window (i.e., frame) is shifted by +1 bp for a total of x frames, where x bp is the width of the maximum bin window size in any binning scheme. Pairwise similarity indices between different community fingerprints are calculated for each of the x frames. To best address the null hypothesis of the community comparison, the maximum similarity value of all x frames is then used in downstream analyses to compare the communities. We believe this binning technique provides the most accurate and least biased comparison between different microbial fingerprints.},

abstract = {Background: Experimental designs that take advantage of high-throughput sequencing to generate datasets include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomic analysis and selective growth experiments. In each case the underlying data are similar and are composed of counts of sequencing reads mapped to a large number of features in each sample. Despite this underlying similarity, the data analysis methods used for these experimental designs are all different, and do not translate across experiments. Alternative methods have been developed in the physical and geological sciences that treat similar data as compositions. Compositional data analysis methods transform the data to relative abundances with the result that the analyses are more robust and reproducible.Results: Data from an in vitro selective growth experiment, an RNA-seq experiment and the Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene abundance dataset were examined by ALDEx2, a compositional data analysis tool that uses Bayesian methods to infer technical and statistical error. The ALDEx2 approach is shown to be suitable for all three types of data: it correctly identifies both the direction and differential abundance of features in the differential growth experiment, it identifies a substantially similar set of differentially expressed genes in the RNA-seq dataset as the leading tools and it identifies as differential the taxa that distinguish the tongue dorsum and buccal mucosa in the Human Microbiome Project dataset. The design of ALDEx2 reduces the number of false positive identifications that result from datasets composed of many features in few samples.Conclusion: Statistical analysis of high-throughput sequencing datasets composed of per feature counts showed that the ALDEx2 R package is a simple and robust tool, which can be applied to RNA-seq, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differential growth datasets, and by extension to other techniques that use a similar approach.},

abstract = {The different classification of particle-size fractions used in Australia compared with other countries presents a problem for the immediate adoption of the exotic pedotransfer functions. Australia adopted the international system which defined silt as particles with diameters in the range 2–20 m, while the USDA/FAO define it as 2–50 m. We present empirical equations to convert between the two systems. The USDA/FAO textural classes were also plotted in the International system's coordinate. The USDA/FAO classes in the International system had a ‘boomerang' shape and only occupy 60{\%} of the triangle. Particle-size data showed that the data are evenly distributed in the USDA/FAO triangle, while most data are concentrated in the boomerang in the International system. We therefore suggest that it would seem wise for most countries to consider adopting the particle-size limits and texture classes of the USDA/FAO system.},

abstract = {Delftia sp. strain JD2 is a plant-growth-promoting bacterium that enhances legume nodulation and growth, acting as nodule-assisting bacterium during the co-inoculation of plants with rhizobial strains. In this work, we evaluate how the co-inoculation of alfalfa with Sinorhizobium meliloti U143 and JD2 increases plant yield under greenhouse conditions and we analyze the pattern of secreted bioactive compounds which may be involved in the microbe-plant communication. The chemical composition of extracellular cultures (EC) produced in hydroponic conditions (collected 4, 7, and 14 days after bacterial treatment) were characterized using different chromatographic and elucidation techniques. In addition, we assessed the effect that plant irrigation with cell-free EC, produced during co-inoculation experiments, would have on plant yield. Results showed increased alfalfa shoot and root matter, suggesting that U143-JD2 co-inoculation might be a beneficial agricultural practice. The pattern of secreted secondary metabolites among treatments showed important differences. Qualitative and quantitative changes in phenolic compounds (including flavonoids), organic acids, and volatile compounds were detected during the early microbe-plant interaction, suggesting that the production of some molecules positively affects the microbe-plant association. Finally, the irrigation of co-inoculated plants with cell-free EC under greenhouse conditions increased plant yield over agronomic expectations. This effect might be attributed to the bioactive secondary metabolites incorporated during the irrigation.},

abstract = {Humic substances (HS) are an operationally defined fraction of soil organic matter, and they represent the largest pool of recalcitrant organic carbon in the terrestrial environment. It has traditionally been thought that extractable HS consist of novel categories of cross-linked macromolecular structures. In this study, advanced nuclear magnetic resonance approaches were used to study the major components (proteins, carbohydrates, aliphatic biopolymers, and lignin) that are known to be present in HS, and to identify their fingerprints in humic mixtures. Theoretically, once all known components have been identified, the remaining signals should be from materials with novel structures, themselves forming a distinct chemical category of humic materials. Surprisingly, nearly all of the NMR signals in traditional HS fractions could be assigned to intact and degrading biopolymers. We therefore suggest that the vast majority of operationally defined humic material in soils is a very complex mixture of microbial and plant biopolymers and their degradation products but not a distinct chemical category. It is important to note this work in no way rules out the existence of a distinct category of humic macromolecules, either at low abundance in the soluble fraction from young soils, in diagenetically evolved samples (for example lignites, etc.), or in the nonextractable humin fraction. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

This contribution provides an update on the current knowledge on metabolic and phylogenetic diversity of anaerobic microorganisms that are capable of dehalogenating-or completely mineralizing-halogenated hydrocarbons by fermentative, oxidative, or reductive pathways. In particular, research of the past decade has focused on halorespiring anaerobes, which couple the dehalogenation by dedicated enzyme systems to the generation of energy by electron transport-driven phosphorylation. Significant advances in the biochemistry and molecular genetics of degradation pathways have revealed mechanistic and structural similarities between dehalogenating enzymes from phylogenetic ally distinct anaerobes. The availability of two almost complete genome sequences of halorespiring isolates recently enabled comparative and functional genomics approaches, setting the stage for the further exploitation of halorespiring and other anaerobic dehalogenating microbes as dedicated degraders in biological remediation processes.},

abstract = {Background: Experimental designs that take advantage of high-throughput sequencing to generate datasets include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomic analysis and selective growth experiments. In each case the underlying data are similar and are composed of counts of sequencing reads mapped to a large number of features in each sample. Despite this underlying similarity, the data analysis methods used for these experimental designs are all different, and do not translate across experiments. Alternative methods have been developed in the physical and geological sciences that treat similar data as compositions. Compositional data analysis methods transform the data to relative abundances with the result that the analyses are more robust and reproducible.Results: Data from an in vitro selective growth experiment, an RNA-seq experiment and the Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene abundance dataset were examined by ALDEx2, a compositional data analysis tool that uses Bayesian methods to infer technical and statistical error. The ALDEx2 approach is shown to be suitable for all three types of data: it correctly identifies both the direction and differential abundance of features in the differential growth experiment, it identifies a substantially similar set of differentially expressed genes in the RNA-seq dataset as the leading tools and it identifies as differential the taxa that distinguish the tongue dorsum and buccal mucosa in the Human Microbiome Project dataset. The design of ALDEx2 reduces the number of false positive identifications that result from datasets composed of many features in few samples.Conclusion: Statistical analysis of high-throughput sequencing datasets composed of per feature counts showed that the ALDEx2 R package is a simple and robust tool, which can be applied to RNA-seq, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differential growth datasets, and by extension to other techniques that use a similar approach.},

abstract = {The influence of anaerobic conditions on aqueous-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bioavailability was investigated in laboratory microcosms. Highly aged ({\textgreater}70 years), PAH-contaminated soil was incubated under anaerobic conditions by using various anaerobic headspaces, anaerobic headspaces with an oxygen-scavenging complex (titanium(III) citrate) in the aqueous phase, or anaerobic headspaces with electron-acceptor amendments in the aqueous phase. Incubation of soil solely under anaerobic conditions resulted in increased aqueous concentrations of all PAHs tested (fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene). Benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene extractable concentrations were above aqueous solubility, by as much as an order of magnitude for the latter. The degree of solubility increase observed was a function of molecular weight of the PAH regardless of initial soil concentration, suggesting formation of stable PAH-soluble organic matter associations. The soil samples incubated aerobically for 90 d before imposition of anaerobic conditions did not release PAHs to the aqueous phase. Methanogenic organisms and sulfate-reducing bacteria were seen to have the most significant effect on increases in aqueous-phase PAHs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons made more soluble under anaerobic conditions was available to be degraded or transformed under aerobic conditions.},

abstract = {Extensive application of biochar to soil exerts a profound effect on organic carbon (OC) in soils. However, the impact of biochar on the content and composition of OC has not been comprehensively summarized. This review provided a detailed examination on the stability of biochar and its effect on the amount, composition and turnover of soil OC, with key limitations and issues recognized. The direct input of labile and stable OC of biochar to soil OC pool, and indirect effects of biochar on soil OC by affecting soil physicochemical and biological properties were discussed. Both low stability of biochar and biochar-induced strong positive priming effect on OC mineralization were commonly observed in sandy soil added with biochar produced from manure at low temperature. The stable OC of biochar was composed of both aromatic OC and the OC fractions stabilized by soil minerals. Biochar mainly increased the formation of macro-aggregates, and this promotion was more intense for clayey soil added with manure-based low temperature-biochar. Additionally, potential influential mechanisms were proposed to explain the effect of biochar addition on amount and composition of humic substances in soils. This review will shed lights on the effect of biochar application on the amount, composition and turnover of native soil OC, and improve the understanding of the ecological effect of biochar on the soil functions.},

The cytotoxicity of the vehicles was evaluated on the basis of cell viability using the hemocytometric trypan blue exclusion method and cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. Dimethylacetamide, absolute ethanol and polyethylene glycol 400 were evaluated as vehicles for solubilizing various hydrophobic compounds. The compounds were found to be most soluble in dimethylacetamide but this solvent was extremely cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells. Similarly, 1{\%} absolute ethanol solubilized the compounds in culture media at a concentration of 10(-5)M, but was also cytotoxic. 0.1{\%} absolute ethanol in the culture media was non-cytotoxic but was unable to solubilize these hydrophobic compounds. Polyethylene glycol 400 was found to be too viscous to use alone. However, upon optimizing the ratio of absolute ethanol and polyethylene glycol 400, a mixture of 45{\%} absolute ethanol plus 55{\%} polyethylene glycol 400 at a final concentration of 0.1{\%} was used as vehicle solubilized the hydrophobic compounds (10(-5)M) in growth media and non-cytotoxic on all the cell lines tested.

The concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) and its metabolites 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE) were monitored during an 8-week remediation process. Physicochemical characterization of the treated soil was performed before and after the bioremediation process. The isolation and identification of predominant microorganisms during the remediation process were also carried out. The efficiency of detoxification was evaluated after each bioremediation protocol. Humidity and pH and the heterotrophic microorganism count were monitored weekly. The DDT concentration was reduced by 79{\%} after 8weeks via biostimulation with surfactant addition (B+S) and 94.3{\%} via biostimulation alone (B). Likewise, the concentrations of the metabolites DDE and DDD were reduced to levels below the quantification limits. The microorganisms isolated during bioremediation were identified as Bacillus thuringiensis, Flavobacterium sp., Cuprivadius sp., Variovorax soli, Phenylobacterium sp. and Lysobacter sp., among others. Analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allowed visualization of the colonization patterns of soil particles. The toxicity of the soil before and after bioremediation was evaluated using Vibrio fischeri as a bioluminescent sensor. A decrease in the toxic potential of the soil was verified by the increase of the concentration/effect relationship EC50 to 26.9{\%} and 27.2{\%} for B+S and B, respectively, compared to 0.4{\%} obtained for the soil before treatment and 2.5{\%} by natural attenuation after 8weeks of treatment.},

These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in normal physiological function and disease.},

abstract = {Long-term effects of forest disturbance 25 yr ago on lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharide pools in an unmanaged high-elevation Norway spruce (Picea abies L. [Karst.]) forest were investigated by comparing three dieback sites with three adjacent control sites with non-infested spruce on identical soils. Samples were taken from the forest floor and the mineral soil; one Ah horizon sample per site was physically fractionated into density and particle size fractions. Additionally, changes in the above- and belowground input of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides after forest dieback were quantified. Lignin and its degree of structural alteration in plant and soil samples were assessed by CuO oxidation and subsequent analysis of the lignin phenols. Non-cellulosic polysaccharides were determined after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), derivatisation of their neutral sugar monomers by reduction to alditols, and subsequent acetylation. The total plant-derived input of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides to the soil was similar for the dieback and the control sites. The chemical composition of the input has changed considerably after forest dieback, as shown by significantly higher syringyl/vanillyl (S/V) ratios and significantly lower (galactose+mannose)/(arabinose+xylose) (GM/AX) ratios. This indicates a changed plant input and a higher contribution of microbial sugars. Contents of lignin phenols in the forest floor and coarse particle size fractions of the A horizons were significantly smaller at the dieback sites (p{\textless}0.01). Moreover, larger acid-to-aldehyde ratios of vanillyl units (Ac/Al)v indicated an increased degree of lignin phenol alteration. Also contents of neutral sugars were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) smaller in the forest floor, but not in the A horizons of the dieback sites. The GM/AX mass ratios as well as the (rhamnose+fucose)/(arabinose+xylose) (RF/AX) ratios in the forest floor and coarse particle size fractions of the mineral topsoil were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) larger after forest dieback, indicating a larger relative contribution of microbial sugars. In general, the lignin phenol and neutral sugar pools of all three soil types exhibited similar response patterns to the changed site conditions. Our results demonstrate that the lignin and neutral sugar pools of humic topsoil horizons are highly sensitive to forest disturbances. However, the two compounds show different patterns in the mineral soil, with the major neutral sugar pool being stabilized against changes whereas the lignin phenol pool decreases significantly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Variations in the amplitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 have shown an association with surface air temperature consistent with the hypothesis that warmer temperatures have promoted increases in plant growth during summer and/or plant respiration during winter in the northern high latitudes. Here we present evidence from satellite data that the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation increased from 1981 to 1991 in a manner that is suggestive of an increase in plant growth associated with a lengthening of the active growing season. The regions exhibiting the greatest increase lie between 45°N and 70°N, where marked warming has occurred in the spring time due to an early disappearance of snow. The satellite data are concordant with an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeding 20{\%} since the early 1970s, and an advance of up to seven days in the timing of the drawdown of CO2 in spring and early summer. Thus, both the satellite data and the CO2 record indicate that the global carbon cycle has responded to interannual fluctuations in surface air temperature which, although small at the global scale, are regionally highly significant.},

abstract = {The impact of pesticide residues on human health is a worldwide problem, as human exposure to pesticides can occur through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. Regulatory jurisdictions have promulgated the standard values for pesticides in residential soil, air, drinking water, and agricultural commodity for years. Until now, more than 19,400 pesticide soil regulatory guidance values (RGVs) and 5400 pesticide drinking water maximum concentration levels (MCLs) have been regulated by 54 and 102 nations, respectively. Over 90 nations have provided pesticide agricultural commodity maximum residue limits (MRLs) for at least one of the 12 most commonly consumed agricultural foods. A total of 22 pesticides have been regulated with more than 100 soil RGVs, and 25 pesticides have more than 100 drinking water MCLs. This research indicates that those RGVs and MCLs for an individual pesticide could vary over seven (DDT drinking water MCLs), eight (Lindane soil RGVs), or even nine (Dieldrin soil RGVs) orders of magnitude. Human health risk uncertainty bounds and the implied total exposure mass burden model were applied to analyze the most commonly regulated and used pesticides for human health risk control. For the top 27 commonly regulated pesticides in soil, there are at least 300 RGVs (8{\%} of the total) that are above all of the computed upper bounds for human health risk uncertainty. For the top 29 most-commonly regulated pesticides in drinking water, at least 172 drinking water MCLs (5{\%} of the total) exceed the computed upper bounds for human health risk uncertainty; while for the 14 most widely used pesticides, there are at least 310 computed implied dose limits (28.0{\%} of the total) that are above the acceptable daily intake values. The results show that some worldwide standard values were not derived conservatively enough to avoid human health risk by the pesticides, and that some values were not computed comprehensively by considering all major human exposure pathways.},

abstract = {Due to increasing regulations and restrictions, there is an urgent need to develop effective alternatives to chemical-dependent fumigation control of soilborne pests and pathogens. Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) is one such alternative showing great promise for use in the control of soilborne pathogens and pests. This method involves the application of a carbon source, irrigation to field capacity, and covering the soil with a plastic tarp. While the mechanisms of ASD are not completely understood, they appear to be a combination of changes in the soil microbial community composition, production of volatile organic compounds, and the generation of lethal anaerobic conditions. The variety of materials and options for ASD application, including carbon sources, soil temperature, and plastic tarp type, influence the efficacy of pathogen suppression and disease control. Currently, both dry (e.g., rice bran) and liquid (e.g., ethanol) carbon sources are commonly used, but with different results depending on environmental conditions. While solarization is not an essential component of ASD, it can enhance efficacy. Understanding the mechanisms that mediate biological changes occurring in the soil during ASD will facilitate our ability to increase ASD efficacy while enhancing its commercial viability.},

abstract = {Humic acids (HA) are ubiquitous redox-active compounds of natural aquatic and soil systems. Here we studied the potential of HA as reductants for chlorinated aliphatic pollutants. To avoid artifacts potentially involved when studying chemically reduced HA, we prepared electrochemically reduced soil, aquatic and synthetic HA, and anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AHQDS), a model compound for hydroquinone moieties in HA. Both reduced HA and AHQDS reduced hexachloroethane (HCE) at appreciable rates. Some reduction of HCE by HA, however, occurred even before electrochemical reduction of the humic acids. This indicates that a small fraction of reduced moieties in HA persists at oxic conditions for some time. The initial reaction followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, and tetrachloroethylene was the only halogenated product. The relatively small variations in carbonnormalized rate constants, kDOC, found indicate that despite inherent variations in concentration, accessibility, and reactivity of redox-active groups in HA of various origins their overall dechlorination activity is fairly constant. However, HCE transformation rate constants and reducing capacities of different HA did not correlate. Rate constants normalized to both carbon content and reducing capacity of HA clearly indicate that reduced functional groups in different HA exhibit different reactivities. Our results together with the factthat reduced HA can be formed by a variety of microbiological and chemical processes suggest that HA could play a significant role as reductants in the reductive transformation of subsurface contaminants and that such a process could potentially be enhanced at contaminated sites by addition of reducible natural organic matter.},

abstract = {The complete genomes of three strains from the phylum Acidobacteria were compared. Phylogenese analysis placed them as a unique phylum. They share genomic traits with members of the Proteobacteria, the Cyanobac-teria, and the Fungi. The three strains appear to be versatile heterotrophs. Genomic and culture traits indicate the use of carbon sources that span simple sugars to more complex substrates such as hemicellulose, cellulose, and chitin. The genomes encode low-specificity major facilitator superfamily transporters and high-affinity ABC transporters for sugars, suggesting that they are best suited to low-nutrient conditions. They appear capable of nitrate and nitrite reduction but not N 2 fixation or denitriflcation. The genomes contained numerous genes that encode siderophore receptors, but no evidence of siderophore production was found, suggesting that they may obtain iron via interaction with other microorganisms. The presence of cellulose synthesis genes and a large class of novel high-molecular-weight excreted proteins suggests potential traits for desiccation resistance, biofilm formation, and/or contribution to soil structure. Polyketide synthase and macrolide glycosylation genes suggest the production of novel antimicrobial compounds. Genes that encode a variety of novel proteins were also identified. The abundance of acidobacteria in soils worldwide and the breadth of potential carbon use by the sequenced strains suggest significant and previously unrecognized contributions to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Combining our genomic evidence with available culture traits, we postulate that cells of these isolates are long-lived, divide slowly, exhibit slow metabolic rates under low-nutrient conditions, and are well equipped to tolerate fluctuations in soil hydration.

abstract = {The comparison of genetic divergence or genetic distances, estimated by pairwise F(ST) and related statistics, with geographical distances by Mantel test is one of the most popular approaches to evaluate spatial processes driving population structure. There have been, however, recent criticisms and discussions on the statistical performance of the Mantel test. Simultaneously, alternative frameworks for data analyses are being proposed. Here, we review the Mantel test and its variations, including Mantel correlograms and partial correlations and regressions. For illustrative purposes, we studied spatial genetic divergence among 25 populations of Dipteryx alata (“Baru”), a tree species endemic to the Cerrado, the Brazilian savannas, based on 8 microsatellite loci. We also applied alternative methods to analyze spatial patterns in this dataset, especially a multivariate generalization of Spatial Eigenfunction Analysis based on redundancy analysis. The different approaches resulted in similar estimates of the magnitude of spatial structure in the genetic data. Furthermore, the results were expected based on previous knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying genetic variation in this species. Our review shows that a careful application and interpretation of Mantel tests, especially Mantel correlograms, can overcome some potential statistical problems and provide a simple and useful tool for multivariate analysis of spatial patterns of genetic divergence.},

abstract = {The combination of concurrent soil degradation and restoration scenarios in a long-term experiment with contrasting treatments under steady-state conditions, similar soil texture and climate make the Highfield land-use change experiment at Rothamsted Research unique. We used soil from this experiment to quantify rates of change in organic matter (OM) fractions and soil structural stability (SSS) six years after the management changed. Soil degradation included the conversion of grassland to arable and bare fallow management, while soil restoration comprised introduction of grassland in arable and bare fallow soil. Soils were tested for clay dispersibility measured on two macro-aggregate sizes (DispClay 1–2 mm and DispClay 8–16 mm) and clay-SOM disintegration (DI, the ratio between clay particles retrieved without and with SOM removal). The SSS tests were related to soil organic carbon (SOC), permanganate oxidizable C (POXC) and hot water-extractable C (HWC). The decrease in SOC after termination of grassland was greater than the increase in SOC when introducing grassland. In contrast, it was faster to restore degraded soil than to degrade grassland soil with respect to SSS at macro-aggregate scale. The effect of management changes was more pronounced for 8–16 mm than 1–2 mm aggregates indicating a larger sensitivity towards tillage-induced breakdown of binding agents in larger aggregates. At microscale, SSS depended on SOC content regardless of management. Soil management affected macroscale structural stability beyond what is revealed from measuring changes in OM fractions, underlining the need to include both bonding and binding mechanisms in the interpretation of changes in SSS induced by management.},

abstract = {A 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)-degrading bacterium was isolated from soil samples that had been enriched with DDT over a prolonged period of time; these samples were collected from the sewer sludge of a pesticide factory and from DDT-contaminated fields. This consortium was acclimated by repeated passage through a mineral salt medium containing increasing concentrations of DDT. We examined the effects of various factors such as the pH, temperature, concentration of DDT, and the presence of an additional carbon source on the degradation rate of DDT. Based on the analysis of the phenotype, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and 16S rDNA, the strain KK was identified to belong to the bacteria Alcaligenes. The results showed that at the end of 10 days, the rate of degradation of DDT by the strain KK was 66.5{\%}. When the additional carbon source concentration, pH, concentration of DDT, and cultivation temperature is 0.5{\%}, 6, 10 mg l-1, and 30°C, respectively, the biodegradation rate peaks. The results also suggested that (1) bacterial growth increases positively with an increase in the carbon source concentration; (2) the appropriate pH is between 8.0 and 10.0; and (3) the optimal temperature and DDT concentration are 30°C and 10 mg l-1, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The influence of anaerobic conditions on aqueous-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bioavailability was investigated in laboratory microcosms. Highly aged ({\textgreater}70 years), PAH-contaminated soil was incubated under anaerobic conditions by using various anaerobic headspaces, anaerobic headspaces with an oxygen-scavenging complex (titanium(III) citrate) in the aqueous phase, or anaerobic headspaces with electron-acceptor amendments in the aqueous phase. Incubation of soil solely under anaerobic conditions resulted in increased aqueous concentrations of all PAHs tested (fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene). Benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene extractable concentrations were above aqueous solubility, by as much as an order of magnitude for the latter. The degree of solubility increase observed was a function of molecular weight of the PAH regardless of initial soil concentration, suggesting formation of stable PAH-soluble organic matter associations. The soil samples incubated aerobically for 90 d before imposition of anaerobic conditions did not release PAHs to the aqueous phase. Methanogenic organisms and sulfate-reducing bacteria were seen to have the most significant effect on increases in aqueous-phase PAHs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons made more soluble under anaerobic conditions was available to be degraded or transformed under aerobic conditions.},

abstract = { Hydrocarbons are worldwide-distributed pollutants that disturb various ecosystems. The aim of this study was to characterize the short-lapse dynamics of soil microbial communities in response to hydrocarbon pollution and different bioremediation treatments. Replicate diesel-spiked soil microcosms were inoculated with either a defined bacterial consortium or a hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial enrichment and incubated for 12 weeks. The microbial community dynamics was followed weekly in microcosms using Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Both the bacterial consortium and enrichment enhanced hydrocarbon degradation in diesel-polluted soils. A pronounced and rapid bloom of a native gammaproteobacterium was observed in all diesel-polluted soils. A unique operational taxonomic unit (OTU) related to the Alkanindiges genus represented ∼0.1{\%} of the sequences in the original community but surprisingly reached {\textgreater}60{\%} after 6 weeks. Despite this Alkanindiges -related bloom, inoculated strains were maintained in the community and may explain the differences in hydrocarbon degradation. This study shows the detailed dynamics of a soil bacterial bloom in response to hydrocarbon pollution, resembling microbial blooms observed in marine environments. Rare community members presumably act as a reservoir of ecological functions in high-diversity environments, such as soils. This rare-to-dominant bacterial shift illustrates the potential role of a rare biosphere facing drastic environmental disturbances. Additionally, it supports the concept of “conditionally rare taxa,” in which rareness is a temporary state conditioned by environmental constraints. },

abstract = {This paper reviews the current knowledge of microbial processes affecting C sequestration in agroecosystems. The microbial contribution to soil C storage is directly related to microbial community dynamics and the balance between formation and degradation of microbial byproducts. Soil microbes also indirectly influence C cycling by improving soil aggregation, which physically protects soil organic matter (SOM). Consequently, the microbial contribution to C sequestration is governed by the interactions between the amount of microbial biomass, microbial community structure, microbial byproducts, and soil properties such as texture, clay mineralogy, pore-size distribution, and aggregate dynamics. The capacity of a soil to protect microbial biomass and microbially derived organic matter (MOM) is directly and/or indirectly (i.e., through physical protection by aggregates) related to the reactive properties of clays. However, the stabilization of MOM in the soil is also related to the efficiency with which microorganisms utilize substrate C and the chemical nature of the byproducts they produce. Crop rotations, reduced or no-tillage practices, organic farming, and cover crops increase total microbial biomass and shift the community structure toward a more fungal-dominated community, thereby enhancing the accumulation of MOM. A quantitative and qualitative improvement of SOM is generally observed in agroecosystems favoring a fungal-dominated community, but the mechanisms leading to this improvement are not completely understood. Gaps within our knowledge on MOM-C dynamics and how they are related to soil properties and agricultural practices are identified.},

abstract = {The amount of nitrogen stored in soil is related to climate through biotic processes associated with productivity of vegetation and decomposition of organic matter. Other factors, particularly rainfall input, dry deposition input, nitrogen fixation and losses of inorganic nitrogen due to leaching contribute to the variability of nitrogen storage. Here we report that soil nitrogen storage ranges from 0.2 kg m-3 in warm deserts to 2 kg m-3 in rain tundra, with a peak of 1.6 kg m-3 in subtropical wet forests. Soil carbon storage shows a similar pattern. The global nitrogen pool in the surface metre of soil comprises an estimated 9.5 × 1013 kg. Each soil profile examined was classified according to the Holdridge life zone1 in which it was found. Soil carbon/nitrogen ratios range from {\textless}10 in tropical deserts to {\textgreater}20 in cool, wet forests or rain forests. We determined C/N ratios of 15-20 in cool life zones and 10-15 in warm life zones. These results indicate that: (1) Relatively large amounts of soil nitrogen in wet tropical regions are associated with recalcitrant humic materials in an advanced state of decay, with low C/N ratios; (2) the seasonal climate contrast in temperate regions, combined with variable litter quality due to the mix of coniferous and deciduous species, results in moderate carbon and nitrogen storage in soil and variable C/N ratios; and (3) slow decomposition in wet tundra regions results in high carbon and nitrogen storage, with high C/N ratios. {\textcopyright} 1985 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of long-term application of different organic fertilizers (sewage sludge, farmyard manure, compost) as compared to mineral fertilizer on the structure of the soil organic matter. Capillary electrophoresis was employed for the quantification of monosaccharides and phenolic compounds, whereas NMR and FT-IR were used for the overall characterization of the soils organic matter. Application of farmyard manure results in a higher content of organic matter derived from angiosperms, suggested by the higher levels of syringic and vanillic phenols. Spectroscopic studies show an increase of lignin and lignin-like products in the organic matter of the soil, which may be derived from the cereal straw supplied with farmyard manure. According to spectroscopic analysis, 13C CPMAS-NMR and FT-IR spectra, higher contents of methylene groups (- CH2) from proteins and protein-like compounds, as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, were found in the soil supplied with compost. The monosaccharide (rhamnose, xylose, glucose, mannose, arabinose, fucose and galactose) content was not significantly influenced by the different organic fertilizers, suggesting that the type of amendment used does not affect any of these six studied monomers. Comparing the three organic amendments the most significant differences were observed after long-term application of farmyard manure, with an increase in lignin and lignin-like products in the soil organic matter, and compost, which appears to contribute to an increase of protein and protein-like, as well as carbohydrates content on soil organic matter. The knowledge of such changes can be essential to understand the sorption and bioavailability of pollutants, as well as establish/unestablish ways to recycling organic residues as organic fertilizers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include K-fold cross-validation (K-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including K-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.},

In all cases, extracellular protease production was evident when reaching the stationary phase at 18 and 4 degrees C but was not detected at 30 degrees C. The zymogram revealed the secretion of one extracellular protease per isolate, each with different relative electrophoretic mobility. The extracellular proteases produced at 4 degrees C showed thermal activity and stability at 30 degrees C. Both activity and stability at a temperature higher that 10 degrees C have no physiological meaning because the isolates do not experience such temperatures in the Antarctic environment; however, the possible ecological value of cold-active and -stable extracellular proteases is discussed.},

abstract = {White rot fungi can degrade a wide spectrum of recalcitrant organic pollutants, including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this experiment, 20 white rot fungi, belonging to genus Phlebia, were investigated for their ability to degrade dieldrin. Based on the screening results, we further investigated Phlebia acanthocystis, Phlebia brevispora, and Phlebia aurea to determine their degradation capacity and metabolic products towards dieldrin and aldrin. The three fungi were able to remove over 50{\%} of dieldrin in a low nitrogen medium, after 42d of incubation. Three hydroxylated products were detected as metabolites of dieldrin, suggesting that in Phlebia strains, hydroxylation reactions might play an important role in the metabolism of dieldrin. In contrast to dieldrin, aldrin exhibited higher levels of degradation activity. Over 90{\%} of aldrin was removed after 28d of incubation, and several new metabolites of aldrin in microorganisms, including 9-hydroxyaldrin and two carboxylic acid products, were detected in fungal cultures. These results indicate that the methylene moiety of aldrin and dieldrin molecules might be prone to enzymatic attack by white rot fungi. In this study, we describe for the first time a new metabolic pathway of both compounds by fungi of genus Phlebia.},

abstract = {Soil microbial communities are intricately linked to ecosystem functioning because they play important roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Still, we know little about how soil microbial communities will be affected by disturbances expected with climate change. This is a significant gap in understanding, as the stability of microbial communities, defined as a community's ability to resist and recover from disturbances, likely has consequences for ecosystem function. Here, we propose a framework for predicting a community's response to climate change, based on specific functional traits present in the community, the relative dominance of r- and K-strategists, and the soil environment. We hypothesize that the relative abundance of r- and K-strategists will inform about a community's resistance and resilience to climate change associated disturbances. We also propose that other factors specific to soils, such as moisture content and the presence of plants, may enhance a community's resilience. For example, recent evidence suggests microbial grazers, resource availability, and plant roots each impact on microbial community stability. We explore these hypotheses by offering three vignettes of published data that we re-analyzed. Our results show that community measures of the relative abundance of r- and K-strategists, as well as environmental properties like resource availability and the abundance and diversity of higher trophic levels, can contribute to explaining the response of microbial community composition to climate change-related disturbances. However, further investigation and experimental validation is necessary to directly test these hypotheses across a wide range of soil ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2013 de Vries and Shade.},

We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

The present article provides a comprehensive resource to analyze such complex datasets using multivariate methods. It starts from the necessary pre-treatment of data including data transformations and distance calculations, to the application of both gold standard and novel multivariate methods for the integration of different omics data. We illustrate the process of analysis along with detailed results interpretations for six issues representative of the different types of biological questions encountered by chemical ecologists.

abstract = {The more stable fine fraction pool of soil organic matter (FF-SOM; {\textless}0.4 mm) has more nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur (N, P, S) per unit of carbon (C) than the plant material from which it originates and has near constant ratios of C:N:P:S. Consequently, we hypothesised that the sequestration of C-rich crop residue material into the FF-SOM pool could be improved by adding supplementary nutrients to the residues based on these ratios. Here we report on the effect of N, P and S availability on the net humification efficiency (NHE), the change in the size of the FF-SOM pool (as estimated by fine fraction C (FF-C)), following incubation of soil with wheaten straw. Four diverse soils were subjected to seven consecutive incubation cycles, with wheaten straw (10 t ha-1 equivalent) added at the beginning of each cycle, with and without inorganic N, P, S addition (5 kg N, 2 kg P and 1.3 kg S per tonne of straw). This nutrient addition doubled the mean NHE in all soils (from 7{\%} to 15{\%}) and when applied at twice the rate increased NHE further (up to 29{\%}) for the two soils that received this treatment. The FF-N, -P and -S levels increased in concert with FF-C levels in all soils in close agreement with published stoichiometric ratios (C:N:P:S = 10,000:833:200:143). Microbial biomass-C (MB-C) levels were estimated during one incubation cycle and found to increase in parallel with FF-C from 448 $\mu$g MB-C g-1 soil (no nutrient addition) to 727 $\mu$g MB-C g-1 soil (plus nutrients) and 947 $\mu$g MB-C g-1 soil (plus 2× nutrients). There was a significant relationship between MB-C and the change in FF-C during that incubation cycle, providing evidence of a close relationship between the microbial biomass and FF-SOM formation. The two to four-fold increases in NHE achieved with nutrient addition demonstrated that inorganic nutrient availability is critical to sequester C into the more stable FF-SOM pool irrespective of soil type and C input. This has important implications for strategies to build soil fertility or mitigate climate change via increased soil organic C, as the availability and value of these nutrients must be considered. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Differential abundance analysis is controversial throughout microbiome research. Gold standard approaches require laborious measurements of total microbial load, or absolute number of microorganisms, to accurately determine taxonomic shifts. Therefore, most studies rely on relative abundance data. Here, we demonstrate common pitfalls in comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total microbial load. We define the notion of “reference frames”, which provide deep intuition about the compositional nature of microbiome data. In an oral time series experiment, reference frames alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell-count normalized data. Furthermore, reference frames identify consistent, differentially abundant microbes previously undetected in two independent published datasets from subjects with atopic dermatitis. These methods allow reassessment of published relative abundance data to reveal reproducible microbial changes from standard sequencing output without the need for new assays.},

abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in the last few years in understanding the mechanisms of microbial degradation of halogenated aromatic compounds. Much is already known about the degradation mechanisms under aerobic conditions, and metabolism under anaerobiosis has lately received increasing attention. The removal of the halogen substituent is a key step in degradation of halogenated aromatics. This may occur as an initial step via reductive, hydrolytic or oxygenolytic mechanisms, or after cleavage of the aromatic ring at a later stage of metabolism. In addition to degradation, several biotransformation reactions, such as methylation and polymerization, may take place and produce more toxic or recalcitrant metabolites. Studies with pure bacterial and fungal cultures have given detailed information on the biodegradation pathways of several halogenated aromatic compounds. Several of the key enzymes have been purified or studied in cell extracts, and there is an increasing understanding of the organization and regulation of the genes involved in haloaromatic degradation. This review will focus on the biodegradation and biotransformation pathways that have been established for halogenated phenols, phenoxyalkanoic acids, benzoic acids, benzenes, anilines and structurally related halogenated aromatic pesticides. There is a growing interest in developing microbiological methods for clean-up of soil and water contaminated with halogenated aromatic compounds. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.

Although richness over depth layers or sampling dates greatly varied (∼30 and 70-80{\%} new operational taxonomic units (OTU) between two samples with ARISA and MPTS, respectively), overall patterns of community variations were similar with both approaches. Alpha-diversity estimated by ARISA-derived OTU was most similar to that obtained from MPTS-derived OTU defined at the order level. Similar patterns of OTU replacement were also found with MPTS at the family level and with 20-25{\%} rare types removed. Using ARISA or MPTS data sets with lower resolution, such as those containing only resident OTU, yielded a similar set of significant contextual variables explaining bacterial community changes. Hence, ARISA as a rapid and low-cost fingerprinting technique represents a valid starting point for more in-depth exploration of community composition, when complemented by the detailed taxonomic description offered by MPTS.},

abstract = {Natural sorbents including one humic acid (HA), humins (HMs), nonhydrolyzable carbons (NHCs), and engineered sorbents (biochars) were subject to bleaching to selectively remove a fraction of aromatic C. The structural properties and sorption isotherm data of phenanthrene (Phen) by original and bleached sorbents were obtained. Significant correlations between Phen Koc values by all sorbents and their organic carbon (OC)-normalized CO2 cumulative surface area (CO2-SA/OC) suggested that nanopore-filling mechanism could dominate Phen sorption. After bleaching, natural sorbents still contained large amounts of aromatic C, which are resistant to bleaching, suggesting that they are derived from condensed or nonbiodegradable organic matter (OM). After eliminating the effect of aromatic C remaining in the bleached samples, a general trend of increasing CO2-SA/OC of natural sorbents with increasing aliphaticity was observed, suggesting that nanopores of natural sorbents are partially derived from their aliphatic moieties. Conversely, positive relationships between CO2-SA/OC or Phen logKoc of engineered sorbents and their aromaticity indicated the aromatic structures of engineered sorbents primarily contribute to their nanopores and dominate their sorption of HOCs. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrated that the role of structure and microporosity in Phen sorption is dependent on the sources of sorbents.},

Significant reduction in mortality of the insects was observed in DDT‐ and dieldrin‐amended soil samples aged for 30 d, and toxicity decreased further with additional aging. After 270 d, DDT and dieldrin were no longer toxic to house flies, and dieldrin was no longer toxic to fruit flies and cockroaches at 120 d. Nevertheless, 84.7{\%} of the DDT and 92.1{\%} of the dieldrin was recovered from the soil by vigorous extraction after 180 and 270 d, respectively. The results show that toxic chemicals residing in soil become less toxic with time, the extent of decline in bioavailability may differ among different species, and vigorous extraction may grossly overestimate toxicity.},

Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated soils were treated for a period of up to 64 days in situ (HCH dumpsite, Lucknow) and ex situ (University of Delhi) in line with three bioremediation approaches. The first approach, biostimulation, involved addition of ammonium phosphate and molasses, while the second approach, bioaugmentation, involved addition of a microbial consortium consisting of a group of HCH-degrading sphingomonads that were isolated from HCH contaminated sites. The third approach involved a combination of biostimulation and bioaugmentation. The efficiency of the consortium was investigated in laboratory scale experiments, in a pot scale study, and in a full-scale field trial. It turned out that the approach of combining biostimulation and bioaugmentation was most effective in achieving reduction in the levels of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-HCH and that the application of a bacterial consortium as compared to the action of a single HCH-degrading bacterial strain was more successful. Although further degradation of $\beta$- and $\delta$-tetrachlorocyclohexane-1,4-diol, the terminal metabolites of $\beta$- and $\delta$-HCH, respectively, did not occur by the strains comprising the consortium, these metabolites turned out to be less toxic than the parental HCH isomers.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

abstract = {Low molecular weight organic substances (LMWOS) in soil and soil solution include mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and carbohydrates. Due to their high bioavailability they play a crucial role in the cycles of C and nutrients in soils. The variety of soil processes that involve LMWOS requires identifying their composition to elucidate reactions and transformations. In most studies, LMWOS are extracted under artificial conditions, e.g. batch experiments, which may overestimate the actual concentrations. This study measures the composition of carbohydrates and amino acids in solution of a Haplic Luvisol leached in a column experiment. A combined system for simultaneous leaching and blowout of CO2 was used to estimate LMWOS decomposition. 14C-labeled glucose was added as a highly sensitive tracer to control the efficiency of the LMWOS extraction by leaching and to estimate LMWOS decomposition during leaching. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), optimized for soil extracts, was used to analyze LMWOS composition. For HPLC optimization, different preparations of leached solutions (filtration vs. centrifugation, and drying vs. no-drying) were compared. For sugar determination, drying had no influence on the solution concentrations. In contrast, amino acid concentrations significantly decreased by drying LMWOS eluted substances. Combining the HPLC identification of eluted substances with 14C tracer application revealed that about 5{\%} of the glucose could be leached unchanged within 786 min (13.1 h), whereas about 84{\%} remained in the soil, 9{\%} were decomposed to CO2, and 2{\%} were transformed to other LMWOS and recovered in the soil solution. The total amino acid concentration (TAC) in soil solution was about 8.2 $\mu$mol l-1, dominated by alanine (14.4{\%} of TAC), glycine (13.4{\%}), glutamic acid (9.9{\%}), serine (9.4{\%}), and leucine (9.3{\%}). The total carbohydrate concentration was about 2.4 $\mu$M, dominated by glucose (29.9{\%}), glucuronic acid (26.8{\%}), and galacturonic acid (17.3{\%}). Ratios of hexoses to pentoses, amino sugars glucosamine to galactosamine, and neutral sugars to uronic acids were determined. All three parameters pointed to the dominant influence of plants as the source of LMWOS in the leached soil solution. Within the small contribution of microorganisms, bacteria dominated over fungi. These used biomarker ratios as well as LMWOS concentrations differed widely from the ones obtained with conventional batch extraction. More research is necessary to evaluate the application of these biomarkers to soil solutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@misc{Hobbie2013a,
abstract = {Understanding microbial transformations in soils is important for predicting future carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. This review questions some methods of assessing one key microbial process, the uptake of labile organic compounds. First, soil microbes have a starving-survival life style of dormancy, arrested activity, and low activity. Yet they are very abundant and remain poised to completely take up all substrates that become available. As a result, dilution assays with the addition of labeled substrates cannot be used. When labeled substrates are transformed into 14CO2, the first part of the biphasic release follows metabolic rules and is not affected by the environment. As a consequence, when identical amounts of isotopically substrates are added to soils from different climate zones, the same percentage of the substrate is respired and the same half-life of the respired 14CO2 from the labeled substrate is estimated. Second, when soils are sampled by a variety of methods from taking 10 cm diameter cores to millimeter-scale dialysis chambers, amino acids (and other organic compounds) appear to be released by the severing of fine roots and mycorrhizal networks as well as from pressing or centrifuging treatments. As a result of disturbance as well as of natural root release, concentrations of individual amino acids of {\~{}}10 $\mu$M are measured. This contrasts with concentrations of a few nanomolar found in aquatic systems and raises questions about possible differences in the bacterial strategy between aquatic and soil ecosystems. The small size of the hyphae (2-10 $\mu$m diameter) and of the fine roots (0.2-2 mm diameter), make it very difficult to sample any volume of soil without introducing artifacts. Third, when micromolar amounts of labeled amino acids are added to soil, some of the isotope enters plant roots. This may be an artifact of the high micromolar concentrations applied. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hobbie and Hobbie.},

abstract = {Long-term effects of forest disturbance 25 yr ago on lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharide pools in an unmanaged high-elevation Norway spruce (Picea abies L. [Karst.]) forest were investigated by comparing three dieback sites with three adjacent control sites with non-infested spruce on identical soils. Samples were taken from the forest floor and the mineral soil; one Ah horizon sample per site was physically fractionated into density and particle size fractions. Additionally, changes in the above- and belowground input of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides after forest dieback were quantified. Lignin and its degree of structural alteration in plant and soil samples were assessed by CuO oxidation and subsequent analysis of the lignin phenols. Non-cellulosic polysaccharides were determined after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), derivatisation of their neutral sugar monomers by reduction to alditols, and subsequent acetylation. The total plant-derived input of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides to the soil was similar for the dieback and the control sites. The chemical composition of the input has changed considerably after forest dieback, as shown by significantly higher syringyl/vanillyl (S/V) ratios and significantly lower (galactose+mannose)/(arabinose+xylose) (GM/AX) ratios. This indicates a changed plant input and a higher contribution of microbial sugars. Contents of lignin phenols in the forest floor and coarse particle size fractions of the A horizons were significantly smaller at the dieback sites (p{\textless}0.01). Moreover, larger acid-to-aldehyde ratios of vanillyl units (Ac/Al)v indicated an increased degree of lignin phenol alteration. Also contents of neutral sugars were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) smaller in the forest floor, but not in the A horizons of the dieback sites. The GM/AX mass ratios as well as the (rhamnose+fucose)/(arabinose+xylose) (RF/AX) ratios in the forest floor and coarse particle size fractions of the mineral topsoil were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) larger after forest dieback, indicating a larger relative contribution of microbial sugars. In general, the lignin phenol and neutral sugar pools of all three soil types exhibited similar response patterns to the changed site conditions. Our results demonstrate that the lignin and neutral sugar pools of humic topsoil horizons are highly sensitive to forest disturbances. However, the two compounds show different patterns in the mineral soil, with the major neutral sugar pool being stabilized against changes whereas the lignin phenol pool decreases significantly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The MetaCyc and KEGG projects have developed large metabolic pathway databases that are used for a variety of applications including genome analysis and metabolic engineering. We present a comparison of the compound, reaction, and pathway content of MetaCyc version 16.0 and a KEGG version downloaded on Feb-27-2012 to increase understanding of their relative sizes, their degree of overlap, and their scope. To assess their overlap, we must know the correspondences between compounds, reactions, and pathways in MetaCyc, and those in KEGG. We devoted significant effort to computational and manual matching of these entities, and we evaluated the accuracy of the correspondences. RESULTS KEGG contains 179 module pathways versus 1,846 base pathways in MetaCyc; KEGG contains 237 map pathways versus 296 super pathways in MetaCyc. KEGG pathways contain 3.3 times as many reactions on average as do MetaCyc pathways, and the databases employ different conceptualizations of metabolic pathways. KEGG contains 8,692 reactions versus 10,262 for MetaCyc. 6,174 KEGG reactions are components of KEGG pathways versus 6,348 for MetaCyc. KEGG contains 16,586 compounds versus 11,991 for MetaCyc. 6,912 KEGG compounds act as substrates in KEGG reactions versus 8,891 for MetaCyc. MetaCyc contains a broader set of database attributes than does KEGG, such as relationships from a compound to enzymes that it regulates, identification of spontaneous reactions, and the expected taxonomic range of metabolic pathways. MetaCyc contains many pathways not found in KEGG, from plants, fungi, metazoa, and actinobacteria; KEGG contains pathways not found in MetaCyc, for xenobiotic degradation, glycan metabolism, and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides. MetaCyc contains fewer unbalanced reactions, which facilitates metabolic modeling such as using flux-balance analysis. MetaCyc includes generic reactions that may be instantiated computationally. CONCLUSIONS KEGG contains significantly more compounds than does MetaCyc, whereas MetaCyc contains significantly more reactions and pathways than does KEGG, in particular KEGG modules are quite incomplete. The number of reactions occurring in pathways in the two DBs are quite similar.},

abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its main metabolites, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE (DDTs in the study included DDT, DOD and DOE), are frequently detected in agricultural soils even though its usage in agriculture was banned in 1980s or earlier. In this study, eleven plants including eight maize (Zea mays) cultivars and three forage species (alfalfa, ryegrass and teosinte) widely cultivated in China were grown in the soils spiked with DDTs to investigate their potential for removal of DDT from the contaminated soils. The plants varied largely in their ability to accumulate and translocate DDTs. with the bic concentration factor (BCF: DDT concentration ratio of the plant tissues to the soils) ranging from 0.014 to 0.25 and the translocation factor (TF: DDT concentration ratio of the shoots to the roots) varying from 0.35 (Zea mays cv Chaotian-23) to 0.76 (Zea mays spp. mexicana). The amount of DDT phytoextraction ranged from 3.89 mu g (ryegrass) to 27.0 mu g (teosinte) and accounted for {\textless} 0.1{\%} of the total initial DDT spiked in the soils. After 70 d, the removal rates reached 47.1-70.3{\%} of the total initial DDTs spiked in the soils with plants while that was only 15.4{\%} in the soils without plant. Moreover, the higher removal rates of DDTs occurred at the first 20 d of experiment, and then the removal rate decreased with time. The highest amount of DDTs phytoextracted was observed in teosinte, followed by Zea mays spp. mexicana but the highest removal rate of DDTs was found in maize (Zea mays cv jinhai-6). Even though phytoextraction is not the main removal process for DDTs, the plant species especially Zea mays cv Jinhai- showed high potential for removing DDTs from the contaminated soils.

abstract = {Mercury is a naturally occurring metal that has elemental (metallic), inorganic, and organic forms. Elemental mercury is a shiny, silver-white liquid (quicksilver) obtained predominantly from the refining of mercuric sulfide in cinnabar ore. Elemental mercury is used to produce chlorine gas and caustic soda for industrial applications. Other major uses include electrical equipment (e.g., thermostats and switches), electrical lamps, thermometers, sphygmomanometers and barometers, and dental amalgam. Inhalation of elemental mercury volatilized from dental amalgam is a major source of mercury exposure in the general population (Halbach, 1994; Kingman et al., 1998; Woods et al., 2007). Accidental spills of elemental mercury, which create an episodic potential for volatization and inhalation of mercury vapor, have often required public health intervention (Zeitz et al., 2002).Also, elemental mercury is used in rituals practiced in some Latin American and Caribbean communities.},

abstract = {Soil microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of organic C allocated to growth over organic C taken up, strongly affects soil carbon (C) cycling. Despite the importance of the microbial CUE for the terrestrial C cycle, very little is known about how it is affected by nutrient availability. Therefore, we studied microbial CUE and microbial biomass turnover time in soils of a long-term fertilization experiment in a temperate grassland comprising five treatments (control, PK, NK, NP, NPK). Microbial CUE and the turnover of microbial biomass were determined using a novel substrate-independent method based on incorporation of 18O from labeled water into microbial DNA. Microbial respiration was 28-37{\%} smaller in all three N treatments (NK, NP, and NPK) compared to the control, whereas the PK treatment did not affect microbial respiration. N-fertilization decreased microbial C uptake, while the microbial growth rate was not affected. Microbial CUE ranged between 0.31 and 0.45, and was 1.3- to 1.4-fold higher in the N-fertilized soils than in the control. The turnover time ranged between 80 and 113 days and was not significantly affected by fertilization. Net primary production (NPP) and the abundance of legumes differed strongly across the treatments, and the fungal:bacterial ratio was very low in all treatments. Structural equation modeling revealed that microbial CUE was exclusively controlled by N fertilization and that neither the abundance of legumes (as a proxy for the quality of the organic matter inputs) nor NPP (as a proxy for C inputs) had an effect on microbial CUE. Our results show that N fertilization did not only decrease microbial respiration, but also microbial C uptake, indicating that less C was intracellularly processed in the N fertilized soils. The reason for reduced C uptake and increased CUE in the N-fertilization treatments is likely an inhibition of oxidative enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds by N in combination with a reduced energy requirement for microbial N acquisition in the fertilized soils. In conclusion, the study shows that N availability can control soil C cycling by affecting microbial CUE, while plant community-mediated changes in organic matter inputs and P and K availability played no important role for C partitioning of the microbial community in this temperate grassland.},

abstract = {Microbiome sequencing data often need to be normalized due to differences in read depths, and recommendations for microbiome analyses generally warn against using proportions or rarefying to normalize data and instead advocate alternatives, such as upper quartile, CSS, edgeR-TMM, or DESeq-VS. Those recommendations are, however, based on studies that focused on differential abundance testing and variance standardization, rather than community-level comparisons (i.e., beta diversity). Also, standardizing the within-sample variance across samples may suppress differences in species evenness, potentially distorting community-level patterns. Furthermore, the recommended methods use log transformations, which we expect to exaggerate the importance of differences among rare OTUs, while suppressing the importance of differences among common OTUs. We tested these theoretical predictions via simulations and a real-world dataset. Proportions and rarefying produced more accurate comparisons among communities and were the only methods that fully normalized read depths across samples. Additionally, upper quartile, CSS, edgeR-TMM, and DESeq-VS often masked differences among communities when common OTUs differed, and they produced false positives when rare OTUs differed. Based on our simulations, normalizing via proportions may be superior to other commonly used methods for comparing ecological communities.},

abstract = {Microbial degradation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)-residues is one of the mechanisms for the removal of this compound from the environment. A DDT-degrading consortium was isolated by long term enrichment of soil samples collected from DDT-contaminated fields. This consortium was acclimated by repeated passages through a mineral salt medium containing increasing concentrations of DDT. This acclimated consortium could degrade 25 ppm of DDT in 144 h. The consortium consisted of four bacteria. Of these, Serratia marcescens DT-1P was used for further studies. Various factors such as inoculum size, concentration of DDT, pH, temperature, presence of co-substrates, the type of carbon source used influenced the degradation of DDT in shake flasks. Complete degradation was observed up to 15 ppm DDT, followed by inhibitory effects at higher concentrations showing a total loss of degradative ability at 50 ppm DDT. Effective degradation of DDT was obtained with the inoculum pre-exposed to DDT for 72 h. Degradation was inhibited in the presence of auxiliary carbon sources such as citrate, rice straw hydrolysate. However, the presence of yeast extract, peptone, glycerol and tryptone soya broth (TSB) showed complete disappearance of DDT. Mesophilic temperatures (26-30 °C) and near neutral pH (6.0-8.0) were most favourable for degradation. This microbial culture holds the potential for use in bioremediation of DDT-contaminated soils, waste deposits and water bodies. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The analysis of amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes has become the most important single approach for microbial diversity studies. The new sequencing technologies allow for sequencing thousands of reads in a single run and a cost-effective option is split into a single run across many samples. However for this type of investigation the key question that needs to be answered is how many samples can be sequenced without biasing the results due to lack of sequence representativeness? In this work we demonstrated that the level of sequencing effort used for analyzing soil microbial communities biases the results and determines the most effective type of analysis for small and large datasets. Many simulations were performed with four independent pyrosequencing-generated 16S rRNA gene libraries from different environments. The analysis performed here illustrates the lack of resolution of OTU-based approaches for datasets with low sequence coverage. This analysis should be performed with at least 90{\%} of sequence coverage. Diversity index values increase with sample size making normalization of the number of sequences in all samples crucial. An important finding of this study was the advantage of phylogenetic approaches for examining microbial communities with low sequence coverage. However, if the environments being compared were closely related, a deeper sequencing would be necessary to detect the variation in the microbial composition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbons are worldwide-distributed pollutants that disturb various ecosystems. The aim of this study was to characterize the short-lapse dynamics of soil microbial communities in response to hydrocarbon pollution and different bioremediation treatments. Replicate diesel-spiked soil microcosms were inoculated with either a defined bacterial consortium or a hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial enrichment and incubated for 12 weeks. The microbial community dynamics was followed weekly in microcosms using Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Both the bacterial consortium and enrichment enhanced hydrocarbon degradation in diesel-polluted soils. A pronounced and rapid bloom of a native gammaproteobacterium was observed in all diesel-polluted soils. A unique operational taxonomic unit (OTU) related to the Alkanindiges genus represented ∼0.1{\%} of the sequences in the original community but surprisingly reached {\textgreater}60{\%} after 6 weeks. Despite this Alkanindiges -related bloom, inoculated strains were maintained in the community and may explain the differences in hydrocarbon degradation. This study shows the detailed dynamics of a soil bacterial bloom in response to hydrocarbon pollution, resembling microbial blooms observed in marine environments. Rare community members presumably act as a reservoir of ecological functions in high-diversity environments, such as soils. This rare-to-dominant bacterial shift illustrates the potential role of a rare biosphere facing drastic environmental disturbances. Additionally, it supports the concept of “conditionally rare taxa,” in which rareness is a temporary state conditioned by environmental constraints.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to determine the sequence and relative abundance of all nucleotides in a biological or environmental sample. A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared. RESULTS: Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data. CONCLUSIONS: In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, "Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?"},

abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.},

abstract = {Contamination of soils with persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as organochlorine pesticide, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, halohydrocarbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is of increasing concern. Microbial degradation is potential mechanism for the removal of POPs, but it is often restricted by low bioavailability of POPs. Thus, it is important to enhance bioavailability of POPs in soil bioremediation. A series of reviews on bioavailability of POPs has been published in the past few years. However, bioavailability of POPs in relation to soil organic matter, minerals and soil microbes has been little studied. To fully understand POPs bioavailability in soil, research on interactions of POPs with soil components and microbial responses in bioavailability limitation conditions are needed. This review focuses on bioavailability mechanisms of POPs in terms of sorption, transport and microbial adaptation, which is particularly novel. In consideration of the significance of bioavailability, further studies should investigate the influence of various bioremediation strategies on POPs bioavailability.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of biochar on the water-soluble arsenic (As) concentration and the extent of organochlorine degradation in a co-contaminated historic sheep-dip soil during a 180-d glasshouse incubation experiment. Soil microbial activity, bacterial community and structure diversity were also investigated. Biochar made from willow feedstock (Salix sp) was pyrolysed at 350 or 550 degrees C and added to soil at rates of 10 g kg(-1) and 20 g kg(-1) (representing 30 t ha(-1) and 60 t ha(-1)). The isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH (lindane), underwent 10-fold and 4-fold reductions in concentration as a function of biochar treatment. Biochar also resulted in a significant reduction in soil DDT levels (P {\textless} 0.01), and increased the DDE: DDT ratio. Soil microbial activity was significantly increased (P {\textless} 0.01) under all biochar treatments after 60 days of treatment compared to the control. 16S amplicon sequencing revealed that biochar-amended soil contained more members of the Chryseobacterium, Flavobacterium, Dyadobacter and Pseudomonadaceae which are known bioremediators of hydrocarbons. We hypothesise that a recorded short-term reduction in the soluble As concentration due to biochar amendment allowed native soil microbial communities to overcome As-related stress. We propose that increased microbiological activity (dehydrogenase activity) due to biochar amendment was responsible for enhanced degradation of organochlorines in the soil. Biochar therefore partially overcame the co-contaminant effect of As, allowing for enhanced natural attenuation of organochlorines in soil.},

abstract = {Summary: Changes in human microbiome are associated with many human diseases. Next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to quantify the microbial composition without the need for laboratory cultivation. One important problem of microbiome data analysis is to identify the environmental/biological covariates that are associated with different bacterial taxa. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are often over-dispersed and include many zeros. To account for such an over-dispersion, we propose to use an additive logistic normal multinomial regression model to associate the covariates to bacterial composition. The model can naturally account for sampling variabilities and zero observations and also allow for a flexible covariance structure among the bacterial taxa. In order to select the relevant covariates and to estimate the corresponding regression coefficients, we propose a group ℓ1 penalized likelihood estimation method for variable selection and estimation. We develop a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to implement the penalized likelihood estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the group ℓ1 penalized multinomial logistic regression and the Dirichlet multinomial regression models in variable selection. We demonstrate the methods using a data set that links human gut microbiome to micro-nutrients in order to identify the nutrients that are associated with the human gut microbiome enterotype. {\textcopyright} 2013, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Rhizodeposition, i.e. the release of carbon into the soil by growing roots, is an important part of the terrestrial carbon cycle. However the in situ nature and dynamics of root-derived carbon in the soil are still poorly understood. Here we made an investigation of the latter in laboratory experiments using 13CO2 pulse chase labelling of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We analyzed the kinetics of 13C-labelled carbon and more specially 13C carbohydrates in the rhizosphere. Wheat seedlings-soil mesocosms were exposed to 13CO2 for 5 hours in controlled chambers and sampled repeatedly during two weeks for 13C/C analysis of organic carbon. After a two-step separation of the soil from the roots, the amount of total organic 13C was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry as well as the amounts of 13C in arabinose, fructose, fucose, glucose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose and xylose. The amount and isotopic ratio of monosaccharides were obtained by capillary gas chromatography coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) after trimethyl-silyl derivatization. Two fractions were analyzed : total (hydrolysable) and soluble monomeric (water extractable) soil sugars. The amount of organic 13C found in the soil, expressed as a percentage of the total photosynthetically fixed 13C at the end of the labelling period, reached 16{\%} in the day following labelling and stabilised at 9{\%} after one week. We concluded that glucose under the form of polymers was the dominant moietie of rhizodeposits. Soluble glucose and fructose were also present. But after 2 days, these soluble sugars had disappeared. Forty percent of the root-derived carbon was in the form of neutral sugars, and exhibited a time-increasing signature of microbial sugars. The composition of rhizospheric sugars rapidly tended towards that of bulk soil organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Long-term effects of forest disturbance 25 yr ago on lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharide pools in an unmanaged high-elevation Norway spruce (Picea abies L. [Karst.]) forest were investigated by comparing three dieback sites with three adjacent control sites with non-infested spruce on identical soils. Samples were taken from the forest floor and the mineral soil; one Ah horizon sample per site was physically fractionated into density and particle size fractions. Additionally, changes in the above- and belowground input of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides after forest dieback were quantified. Lignin and its degree of structural alteration in plant and soil samples were assessed by CuO oxidation and subsequent analysis of the lignin phenols. Non-cellulosic polysaccharides were determined after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), derivatisation of their neutral sugar monomers by reduction to alditols, and subsequent acetylation. The total plant-derived input of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides to the soil was similar for the dieback and the control sites. The chemical composition of the input has changed considerably after forest dieback, as shown by significantly higher syringyl/vanillyl (S/V) ratios and significantly lower (galactose+mannose)/(arabinose+xylose) (GM/AX) ratios. This indicates a changed plant input and a higher contribution of microbial sugars. Contents of lignin phenols in the forest floor and coarse particle size fractions of the A horizons were significantly smaller at the dieback sites (p{\textless}0.01). Moreover, larger acid-to-aldehyde ratios of vanillyl units (Ac/Al)v indicated an increased degree of lignin phenol alteration. Also contents of neutral sugars were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) smaller in the forest floor, but not in the A horizons of the dieback sites. The GM/AX mass ratios as well as the (rhamnose+fucose)/(arabinose+xylose) (RF/AX) ratios in the forest floor and coarse particle size fractions of the mineral topsoil were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) larger after forest dieback, indicating a larger relative contribution of microbial sugars. In general, the lignin phenol and neutral sugar pools of all three soil types exhibited similar response patterns to the changed site conditions. Our results demonstrate that the lignin and neutral sugar pools of humic topsoil horizons are highly sensitive to forest disturbances. However, the two compounds show different patterns in the mineral soil, with the major neutral sugar pool being stabilized against changes whereas the lignin phenol pool decreases significantly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Extracellular enzymes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play a key role in overall microbial activity, growth and survival in the ocean. EPS, being amphiphilic in nature, can act as biological surfactant in an oil spill situation. Extracellular enzymes help microbes to digest and utilize fractions of organic matter, including EPS, which can stimulate growth and enhance microbial activity. These natural processes might have been altered during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill due to the presence of hydrocarbon and dispersant. This study aims to investigate the role of bacterial extracellular enzymes during exposure to hydrocarbons and dispersant. Mesocosm studies were conducted using a water accommodated fraction of oil mixed with the chemical dispersant, Corexit (CEWAF) in seawater collected from two different locations in the Gulf of Mexico and corresponding controls (no additions). Activities of five extracellular enzymes typically found in the EPS secreted by the microbial community - $\alpha$- and $\beta$s-glucosidase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, leucine amino-peptidase - were measured using fluorogenic substrates in three different layers of the mesocosm tanks (surface, water column and bottom). Enhanced EPS production and extracellular enzyme activities were observed in the CEWAF treatment compared to the Control. Higher bacterial and micro-aggregate counts were also observed in the CEWAF treatment compared to Controls. Bacterial genera in the order Alteromonadaceae were the most abundant bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons recovered. Genomes of Alteromonadaceae commonly have alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase, therefore they may contribute significantly to the measured enzyme activities. Only Alteromonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae among bacteria detected here have higher percentage of genes for lipase. Piscirickettsiaceae was abundant; genomes from this order commonly have genes for leucine aminopeptidase. Overall, this study provides insights into the alteration to the microbial processes such as EPS and extracellular enzyme production, and to the microbial community, when exposed to the mixture of oil and dispersant.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Long-term contrasts in agricultural management can shift soil resource availability with potential consequences to microbial carbon (C) use efficiency (CUE) and the fate of C in soils. Isothermal calorimetry was combined with 13 C-labeled glucose stable isotope probing (SIP) of 16S rRNA genes to test the hypothesis that organically managed soils would support microbial communities with greater thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional soils due to a legacy of lower resource availability and a resultant shift toward communities supportive of more oligotrophic taxa. Resource availability was greater in conventionally managed soils, with 3.5 times higher available phosphorus, 5{\%} more nitrate, and 36{\%} more dissolved organic C. The two management systems harbored distinct glucose-utilizing populations of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, with a higher Proteobacteria:Actinobacteria ratio (2.4 vs. 0.7) in conventional soils. Organically managed soils also harbored notable activity of Firmicutes. Thermodynamic efficiency indices were similar between soils, indicating that glucose was metabolized at similar energetic cost. However, differentially abundant glucose utilizers in organically managed soils were positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) priming and negatively correlated to soil nutrient and carbon availability, respiration, and heat production. These correlation patterns were strongly reversed in the conventionally managed soils indicating clear differentiation of microbial functioning related to soil resource availability. Fresh C addition caused proportionally more priming of SOM decomposition (57 vs. 51{\%}) in organically managed soils likely due to mineralization of organic nutrients to satisfy microbial demands during glucose utilization in these more resource deprived soils. The additional heat released from SOM oxidation may explain the similar community level thermodynamic efficiencies between management systems. Restoring fertility to soils with a legacy of nutrient limitation requires a balanced supply of both nutrients and energy to protect stable SOM from microbial degradation. These results highlight the need to consider managing C for the energy it provides to icritical biological processes that underpin soil health.},

abstract = {Human milk has been used as a surrogate for the assessment of body burden and exposure to persistent lipophilic organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). With the exception of restricted use of mirex, the use of persistent, lipophilic OCPs has been banned in Australia since the 1980s. The decline of human body burden of OCPs following their ban in many industrialised countries is well recorded worldwide from the 1970s until the 1990s though little is known on whether these trends are continuing. In this study, 157 human milk samples collected during 2002 and 2003 as well as 24 samples collected in 1993 were analysed as 20 regional pools for 17 OCPs. OCPs were detected in all pooled human milk samples from 2002/03 typically with highest concentrations of p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) (mean ± standard deviation; median concentration 311 ± 174; 279 ng g-1 lipid) followed by $\beta$-hexachlorocyclohexane ($\beta$-HCH) (80 ± 173; 21 ng g-1 lipid). Other OCPs consistently detected included dieldrin (16 ± 6; 17 ng g-1 lipid), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (18 ± 16; 14 ng g-1 lipid), transnonachlor (11 ± 5; 9 ng g-1 lipid) and p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDT) (9 ± 6; 7 ng g-1 lipid). The results from this study indicated that following a substantial decline of OCP concentrations from the early 1980s to the 1990s, little decline could be observed since then. Furthermore the use of multivariate statistics indicated some regional trends with slightly higher levels of the broadly used insecticides DDT and HCH in both historic and recent samples from Melbourne, whereas, sample pools collected from mothers that lived in rural Queensland and New South Wales as well as Adelaide and Sydney showed comparatively higher levels of heptachlor and dieldrin - both of which have been used for termite treatment. These results indicate that even 20 years after the discontinuation of usage, historical use of OCPs rather than exposure via global transport of OCPs is responsible for continuous low exposure in Australia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.},

However, knowledge on the assembly of rhizospheric communities in aged-contaminated industrial soils is still limited, especially with regard to transcriptionally active microbiomes and their link to the quality or quantity of carbon sources. We compared the short-term (2–10 days) dynamics of bacterial communities and potential PAH-degrading bacteria in bare or ryegrass-planted aged-contaminated soil spiked with phenanthrene, put in relation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution. Both resident and active bacterial communities (analyzed from DNA and RNA, respectively) showed higher species richness and smaller dispersion between replicates in planted soils. Root development strongly favored the activity of Pseudomonadales within the first 2 days, and of members of Actinobacteria, Caulobacterales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales within 6–10 days. Plants slowed down the dissipation of phenanthrene, while root exudation provided a cocktail of labile substrates that might preferentially fuel microbial growth. Although the abundance of PAH-degrading genes increased in planted soil, their transcription level stayed similar to bare soil. In addition, network analysis revealed that plants induced an early shift in the identity of potential phenanthrene degraders, which might influence PAH dissipation on the long-term.},

abstract = {Summary: Changes in human microbiome are associated with many human diseases. Next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to quantify the microbial composition without the need for laboratory cultivation. One important problem of microbiome data analysis is to identify the environmental/biological covariates that are associated with different bacterial taxa. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are often over-dispersed and include many zeros. To account for such an over-dispersion, we propose to use an additive logistic normal multinomial regression model to associate the covariates to bacterial composition. The model can naturally account for sampling variabilities and zero observations and also allow for a flexible covariance structure among the bacterial taxa. In order to select the relevant covariates and to estimate the corresponding regression coefficients, we propose a group ℓ1 penalized likelihood estimation method for variable selection and estimation. We develop a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to implement the penalized likelihood estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the group ℓ1 penalized multinomial logistic regression and the Dirichlet multinomial regression models in variable selection. We demonstrate the methods using a data set that links human gut microbiome to micro-nutrients in order to identify the nutrients that are associated with the human gut microbiome enterotype. {\textcopyright} 2013, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {A physiological method to assess the catabolic diversity of soil microbial communities was developed and applied. The method utilises differences between the substrate induced respiration (SIR) responses of microbial communities to simple organic compounds to quantify catabolic diversity. The investigation was conducted in three stages: (1) selection of suitable substrate concentrations; (2) selection of substrates and (3) application of the method to assess the catabolic diversity that had developed in soils over long and short periods. The concentrations of substrates giving optimal respiration response over 4 h were determined in four soils (three pasture and one forest) using 12 substrates selected from a range of amine acids, carboxylic acids, polymers and carbohydrates. Maximum SIR response could be obtained generally over a two-fold range of concentrations for most substrates. These results were used to select substrate, concentrations for testing the SIR responses of five soils (three pasture, one arable, one forest) to 83 simple sugars, carboxylic acids, amino acids, polymers, amines and amides. Principal components analysis (PCA) and calculation of the standard error of individual substrate responses across soils were used to identify the 36 substrates providing the greatest differences in SIR responses between the five so s SIR response profiles were determined using 36 substrates in soils under different management (grass pasture, reseeded grass pasture 2-y pasture ley, arable) and in glucose- amended soil over 3 wk. Analyses revealed that differences in SIR responses between substrates gradually declined with increasing so disturbance from pasture to arable soils. There were only small changes in catabolic diversity of the arable soils amended with glucose, despite a 1.35 fold increase in microbial biomass C during the first d. The physiological technique provided a reasonably rapid and simple method to assess the catabolic diversity of microbial communities without extracting or culturing organisms from soils.},

abstract = {Soil microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of organic C allocated to growth over organic C taken up, strongly affects soil carbon (C) cycling. Despite the importance of the microbial CUE for the terrestrial C cycle, very little is known about how it is affected by nutrient availability. Therefore, we studied microbial CUE and microbial biomass turnover time in soils of a long-term fertilization experiment in a temperate grassland comprising five treatments (control, PK, NK, NP, NPK). Microbial CUE and the turnover of microbial biomass were determined using a novel substrate-independent method based on incorporation of 18O from labeled water into microbial DNA. Microbial respiration was 28-37{\%} smaller in all three N treatments (NK, NP, and NPK) compared to the control, whereas the PK treatment did not affect microbial respiration. N-fertilization decreased microbial C uptake, while the microbial growth rate was not affected. Microbial CUE ranged between 0.31 and 0.45, and was 1.3- to 1.4-fold higher in the N-fertilized soils than in the control. The turnover time ranged between 80 and 113 days and was not significantly affected by fertilization. Net primary production (NPP) and the abundance of legumes differed strongly across the treatments, and the fungal:bacterial ratio was very low in all treatments. Structural equation modeling revealed that microbial CUE was exclusively controlled by N fertilization and that neither the abundance of legumes (as a proxy for the quality of the organic matter inputs) nor NPP (as a proxy for C inputs) had an effect on microbial CUE. Our results show that N fertilization did not only decrease microbial respiration, but also microbial C uptake, indicating that less C was intracellularly processed in the N fertilized soils. The reason for reduced C uptake and increased CUE in the N-fertilization treatments is likely an inhibition of oxidative enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds by N in combination with a reduced energy requirement for microbial N acquisition in the fertilized soils. In conclusion, the study shows that N availability can control soil C cycling by affecting microbial CUE, while plant community-mediated changes in organic matter inputs and P and K availability played no important role for C partitioning of the microbial community in this temperate grassland.},

abstract = {Abstract Traditional methods for enumerating and identifying microbial populations within the rumen can be time consuming and cumbersome. Methods that involve culturing and microscopy can also be inconclusive, particularly when studying anaerobic rumen fungi. A real?time PCR SYBR Green assay, using PCR primers to target total rumen fungi and the cellulolytic bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes, is described, including design and validation. The DNA and crude protein contents with respect to the fungal biomass of both polycentric and monocentric fungal isolates were investigated across the fungal growth stages to aid in standard curve generation. The primer sets used were found to be target specific with no detectable cross?reactivity. Subsequently, the real?time PCR assay was employed in a study to detect these populations within cattle rumen. The anaerobic fungal target was observed to increase 3.6?fold from 0 to 12?h after feeding. The results also indicated a 5.4?fold increase in F. succinogenes target between 0 and 12?h after feeding, whereas R. flavefaciens was observed to maintain more or less consistent levels. This is the first report of a real?time PCR assay to estimate the rumen anaerobic fungal population.},

abstract = {Understanding microbial transformations in soils is important for predicting future carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. This review questions some methods of assessing one key microbial process, the uptake of labile organic compounds. First, soil microbes have a starving-survival life style of dormancy, arrested activity, and low activity. Yet they are very abundant and remain poised to completely take up all substrates that become available. As a result, dilution assays with the addition of labeled substrates cannot be used. When labeled substrates are transformed into 14CO2, the first part of the biphasic release follows metabolic rules and is not affected by the environment. As a consequence, when identical amounts of isotopically substrates are added to soils from different climate zones, the same percentage of the substrate is respired and the same half-life of the respired 14CO2 from the labeled substrate is estimated. Second, when soils are sampled by a variety of methods from taking 10 cm diameter cores to millimeter-scale dialysis chambers, amino acids (and other organic compounds) appear to be released by the severing of fine roots and mycorrhizal networks as well as from pressing or centrifuging treatments. As a result of disturbance as well as of natural root release, concentrations of individual amino acids of {\~{}}10 $\mu$M are measured. This contrasts with concentrations of a few nanomolar found in aquatic systems and raises questions about possible differences in the bacterial strategy between aquatic and soil ecosystems. The small size of the hyphae (2-10 $\mu$m diameter) and of the fine roots (0.2-2 mm diameter), make it very difficult to sample any volume of soil without introducing artifacts. Third, when micromolar amounts of labeled amino acids are added to soil, some of the isotope enters plant roots. This may be an artifact of the high micromolar concentrations applied. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hobbie and Hobbie.},

We stress that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO 2 . Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others. A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation, practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers, through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by agricultural practices, that require in-depth research.},

abstract = {Repeated pesticide exposure may enhance biodegradation through selective enrichment of pesticide-metabolizing microorganisms, particularly when the compound is used as a C and energy source. The relationship between pesticide application history and degradation rate is unclear when the chemical is utilized as a nutrient source other than C. Atrazine, a poor source of C and energy, was chosen as a model compound because it can serve as an N source for some microorganisms. Soils with (H-soil) and without (NH-soil) prior s-triazine treatment history were repeatedly exposed to atrazine and a variety of C and N source amendments. Exposure to atrazine and inorganic-N availability were the dominant factors leading to the development of microbial communities with an enhanced capacity to degrade atrazine. The density of the atrazine-degrading microorganisms increased immediately, up to 1000-fold, with atrazine exposure in the H-soil, but comparable increases were not observed in the NH-soil until 12 weeks following laboratory acclimation, despite high rates of atrazine mineralization in these soils immediately following the acclimation period. Whole-soil fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed that the application of alternative C and N sources in addition to atrazine resulted in a microbial community composition that was distinctly different from that in either the atrazinealone treatment or water controls for both the H- and NH-soils. These data suggest that the microbial communities in both soils were altered differently in response to the treatments but developed a similar enhanced capacity to mineralize atrazine.},

abstract = {Pesticides are used for controlling the develop-ment of various pests in agricultural crops worldwide. Despite their agricultural benefits, pesticides are often considered a serious threat to the environment because of their persistent nature and the anomalies they create. Hence removal of such pesticides from the environment is a topic of interest for the researchers nowadays. During the recent years, use of biological resources to degrade or remove pesticides has emerged as a powerful tool for their in situ degradation and remediation. Fungi are among such bioresources that have been widely characterized and applied for biodegradation and bioremediation of pes-ticides. This review article presents the perspectives of using fungi for biodegradation and bioremediation of pes-ticides in liquid and soil media. This review clearly indicates that fungal isolates are an effective bioresource to degrade different pesticides including lindane, methamidophos, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, atrazine, cypermethrin, dieldrin, methyl parathion, heptachlor, etc. However, rate of fungal degradation of pesticides depends on soil moisture content, nutrient availability, pH, temper-ature, oxygen level, etc. Fungal strains were found to harbor different processes including hydroxylation, de-methylation, dechlorination, dioxygenation, esterification, dehydrochlorination, oxidation, etc during the biodegrada-tion of different pesticides having varying functional groups. Moreover, the biodegradation of different pesti-cides was found to be mediated by involvement of differ-ent enzymes including laccase, hydrolase, peroxidase, es-terase, dehydrogenase, manganese peroxidase, lignin per-oxidase, etc. The recent advances in understanding the fungal biodegradation of pesticides focusing on the pro-cesses, pathways, genes/enzymes and factors affecting the biodegradation have also been presented in this review article.},

abstract = {In order to evaluate the potential of compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) for tracking organochlorine pesticides in soil systems, sample pre-treatment methods have to be developed, which can provide recoveries sufficient for low detection limits without altering the isotope ratio of the target compounds. In this study we tested the compatibility of CSIA with user- and environmentally friendly extraction methods, including the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe procedure (QuEChERS), Ultrasonic Assisted Extraction (USE) and Focused Ultrasonic Extraction (FUSE), as well as clean-up methods, including sulfuric acid clean-up and Florisil (R) column chromatography for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), p,p '-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and their environmental metabolites (chlorinated benzenes, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane - DDD) in soils. We optimized the extraction methods for maximum recovery and pre-concentration. At optimal conditions, all extraction methods and clean-up procedures, as well as the pre-concentration of the extract by solvent evaporation, led to insignificant changes in carbon isotope ratios of the target compounds. We modified the USE procedure to increase the volume of withdrawn organic extract, resulting in a higher pre-concentration of the target compounds by the subsequent solvent evaporation step. This Modified Ultrasonic Assisted Extraction (MUSE) was the most suitable procedure, and it was validated for the determination of carbon isotope ratios of the target compounds using two different types of soil matrices. The method could be applied to analyze carbon isotope ratios of HCHs, DDT, and their chlorinated metabolites in soil samples with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 mg/kg. The analytical uncertainty of MUSE, incorporating both accuracy and precision, was {\textless}= 0.4 parts per thousand. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The main ideas of synonymous codon usage (CU) evolution and translational selection have been deeply influenced by studies with these bacterial groups. In this work we report the analysis of the CU pattern of completely sequenced bacterial genomes that belong to the Enterobacteriaceae. The effect of selection in translation acting at the levels of speed and accuracy, and phylogenetic trends within this group are described. Preferred (optimal) codons were identified. The evolutionary dynamics of these codons were studied and following a Bayesian approach these preferences were traced back to the common ancestor of the family. We found that there is some level of variation in selection among the analysed micro-organisms that is probably associated with lineage-specific trends. The codon bias was largely conserved across the evolutionary time of the family in highly expressed genes and protein conserved regions, suggesting a major role of negative selection. In this sense, the results support the idea that the extant CU bias is finely tuned over the ancestral well-conserved pool of tRNAs.},

abstract = {Summary: Changes in human microbiome are associated with many human diseases. Next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to quantify the microbial composition without the need for laboratory cultivation. One important problem of microbiome data analysis is to identify the environmental/biological covariates that are associated with different bacterial taxa. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are often over-dispersed and include many zeros. To account for such an over-dispersion, we propose to use an additive logistic normal multinomial regression model to associate the covariates to bacterial composition. The model can naturally account for sampling variabilities and zero observations and also allow for a flexible covariance structure among the bacterial taxa. In order to select the relevant covariates and to estimate the corresponding regression coefficients, we propose a group ℓ1 penalized likelihood estimation method for variable selection and estimation. We develop a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to implement the penalized likelihood estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the group ℓ1 penalized multinomial logistic regression and the Dirichlet multinomial regression models in variable selection. We demonstrate the methods using a data set that links human gut microbiome to micro-nutrients in order to identify the nutrients that are associated with the human gut microbiome enterotype. {\textcopyright} 2013, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle-spinning3C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS13C NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterise semi-quantitatively the organic materials contained in particle size and density fractions isolated from five different mineral soils: two Mollisols, two Oxisols and an Andosol. The acquired spectra were analysed to determine the relative proportion of carboxyl, aromatic, O-alkyl and alkyl carbon contained in each fraction. Although similar types of carbon were present in all of the fractions analysed, an influence of both soil type and particle size was evident. The chemical structure of the organic materials contained in the particle size fractions isolated from the Andosol was similar; however, for the Mollisols and Oxisols, the content of O-alkyl, aromatic and alkyl carbon was greatest in the coarse, intermediate and fine fractions, respectively. The compositional differences noted in progressing from the coarser to finer particle size fractions in the Mollisols and Oxisols were consistent with the changes noted in other studies where CP/MAS13C NMR was used to monitor the decomposition of natural organic materials. Changes in the C:N ratio of the particle size fractions supported the proposal that the extent of decomposition of the organic materials contained in the fine fractions was greater than that contained in the coarse fractions. The increased content of aromatic and alkyl carbon in the intermediate size fractions could be explained completely by a selective preservation mechanism; however, the further accumulation of alkyl carbon in the clay fractions appeared to result from both a selective preservation and an in situ synthesis. The largest compositional differences noted for the entire organic fraction of the five soils were observed between soil orders. The differences within orders were smaller. The Mollisols and the Andosol were both dominated by O-alkyl carbon but the Andosol had a lower alkyl carbon content. The Oxisols were dominated by both O-alkyl and alkyl carbon. A model describing the oxidative decomposition of plant materials in mineral soils is proposed and used to explain the influence of soil order and particle size on the chemical composition of soil organic matter in terms of its extent of decomposition and bioavailability. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces and secretes rhamnose-containing glycolipid biosurfactants called rhamnolipids. This review describes rhamnolipid biosynthesis and potential industrial and environmental applications of rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipid production is dependent on central metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis and dTDP-activated sugars, as well as on enzymes participating in the production of the exopolysaccharide alginate. Synthesis of these surfactants is regulated by a very complex genetic regulatory system that also controls different P. aeruginosa virulence-associated traits. Rhamnolipids have several potential industrial and environmental applications including the production of fine chemicals, the characterization of surfaces and surface coatings, as additives for environmental remediation, and as a biological control agent. Realization of this wide variety of applications requires economical commercial-scale production of rhamnolipids.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the conditions that promote the growth and activity of pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP)-degrading microorganisms within mixed microbial systems are needed to shape microbiomes in biotreatment reactors and manage process performance. Available carbon sources influence microbial community structure, and specific carbon sources could potentially be added to end-of-treatment train biotreatment systems (e.g., soil aquifer treatment [SAT]) to select for the growth and activity of a range of microbial phylotypes that collectively degrade target PPCPs. Herein, the impacts of primary carbon sources on PPCP biodegradation and microbial community structure were explored to identify promising carbon sources for PPCP biotreatment application. Six types of primary carbon sources were investigated: casamino acids, two humic acid and peptone mixtures (high and low amounts of humic acid), molasses, an organic acids mixture, and phenol. Biodegradation was tracked for five PPCPs (diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and triclosan). Primary carbon sources were found to differentially impact microbial community structures and rates and efficiencies of PPCP biotransformation. Of the primary carbon sources tested, casamino acids, organic acids, and phenol showed the fastest biotransformation; however, on a biomass-normalized basis, both humic acid-peptone mixtures showed comparable or superior biotransformation. By comparing microbial communities for the different primary carbon sources, abundances of unclassified Beijerinckiaceae, Beijerinckia, Sphingomonas, unclassified Sphingomonadaceae, Flavobacterium, unclassified Rhizobiales, and Nevskia were statistically linked with biotransformation of specific PPCPs.},

This study aimed to link species variation in RPE with plant traits and rhizosphere properties. Four C3 species (chickpea, Cicer arietinum; field pea, Pisum sativum; wheat, Triticum aestivum; and white lupin, Lupinus albus) differing in soil acidification and root exudation, were grown in a C4 soil. The CO2 released from soil was trapped using a newly developed NaOH-trapping system. White lupin and wheat showed greater positive RPEs, in contrast to the negative RPE produced by chickpea. The greatest RPE of white lupin was in line with its capacity to release root exudates, whereas the negative RPE of chickpea was attributed to its great ability to acidify rhizosphere soil. The enhanced RPE of field pea at maturity might result from high nitrogen deposition and release of structural root carbon components following root senescence. Root biomass and length played a minor role in the species variation in RPE. Rhizosphere acidification was shown to be an important factor affecting the magnitude and direction of RPE.

The examined species included sea ice amphipod (Gammarus wilkitzkii), polar cod (Boreogadus saida), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle) and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus). These were analyzed for PFAS, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant of the detected PFAS. Trophic levels and food web transfer of PFAS were determined using stable nitrogen isotopes ($\delta$15N). No correlation was found between PFOS concentrations and trophic level within species. However, a non-linear relationship was established when the entire food web was analyzed. Biomagnification factors displayed values {\textgreater}1 for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), PFOS and $\Sigma$PFAS(7). Multivariate analyses showed that the degree of trophic transfer of PFAS is similar to that of PCB, DDT and PBDE, despite their accumulation through different pathways. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urbanization is associated with shifts in human lifestyles, thus possibly influencing the diversity, interaction and assembly of gut microbiota. However, the question regarding how human gut microbiota adapts to varying lifestyles remains elusive. To understand the relationship between gut microbiota and urbanization, we compared the diversity, interaction and assembly of gut microbial communities of herdsmen from three regions with different levels of urbanization, namely traditional herdsmen (TH), semi-urban herdsmen (SUH) and urban herdsmen (UH). The relative abundance of Prevotella decreased with the degree of urbanization (from TH to UH), whereas that of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium and Blautia showed an opposite trend. Although the alpha diversity measures (observed OTUs and phylogenetic diversity) of gut microbiota were unaffected by urbanization, the beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray-Curtis distances) was significantly influenced by urbanization. Metagenome prediction revealed that the gene functions associated with metabolism (i.e., carbohydrate and lipid metabolism) had significant differences between TH and UH. Network analysis showed that the modularity increased with the degree of urbanization, indicating a high extent of niche differentiation in UH. Meanwhile the trend of network density was opposite, indicating a more complex network in TH. Notably, the relative importance of environmental filtering that governed the community assembly increased with the degree of urbanization, which indicated that deterministic factors (e.g., low-fiber diet) play more important roles than stochastic factors (e.g., stochastic dispersal) in shaping the gut microbiota. A quantification of ecological processes showed a stronger signal of variable selection in UH than TH, implying that different selective pressures cause divergent gut community compositions due to urban lifestyles. Our results suggest that beta diversity, network interactions and ecological processes of gut microbiota may reflect the degree of urbanization, and highlight the adaptation of human gut microbiota to lifestyle changes.},

It is a sub-discipline of ecology, not of statistics or other mathematical discipline. Many of the methods used in numerical ecology have been developed by ecologists, specialists of classification methods, geneticists and other researchers who were facing questions about multivariate data in their fields of study. The field of numerical ecology results from the work of a large number of dedicated scientists who experimented with numerical methods of analysis before and in the computer era. They developed a broad palette of methods of analysis to answer specific ecological questions. The article lists some of the pioneer researchers, as well as the scientists who wrote the first textbooks describing how numerical and statistical analysis of ecological data could and should be done to answer ecological questions and test hypotheses. The field is also indebted to the scientists who developed the many computer packages now available for numerical analysis of ecological data.},

This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links.

We found a strong relationship between different functional genes and their corresponding enzyme activities. This relationship was maintained after considering microbial community structure, total C and soil pH using structural equation modelling. Results showed that the variations in the activity of enzymes involved in C degradation were predicted by the functional gene abundance of the soil microbial community (R 2 {\textgreater}0.90 in all cases). Our findings provide a strong framework for improved predictions on soil C dynamics that could be achieved by adopting a gene-centric approach incorporating the abundance of functional genes into process models.},

Thirteen legume species, two pasture grasses, and three high carboxylate-exuding crop species (Lupinus albus, L. angustifolius, Cicer arietinum) were grown in a glasshouse for six weeks. Rhizosphere carboxylates and root morphological traits were measured. Ornithopus spp. had rhizosphere carboxylates in similar quantities to the Lupinus spp. ({\textgreater} 40 mu mol g(-1) root dry mass). Trifolium subterraneum lines had relatively large average root diameter, reduced specific root length and very short average root hair length resulting in specific root hair cylinder volumes (RHCVs) only 14-20 {\%} of the grasses. However, O. sativus, O. compressus and Biserrula pelecinus had specific RHCVs more comparable to the grasses. Novel pasture legume species with root morphology more comparable to that of grasses than T. subterraneum were identified. Of these, Ornithopus spp. were notable as they also had high rhizosphere carboxylates relative to root dry mass.},

abstract = {Abstract With recent methodological advances, molecular markers are increasingly used for semi‐quantitative analyses of fungal communities. The aim to preserve quantitative relationships between genotypes through PCR places new demands on primers to accurately match target sites and provide short amplicons. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosome encoding genes is a commonly used marker for many fungal groups. Here, we describe three new primers – fITS7, gITS7 and fITS9, which may be used to amplify the fungal ITS2 region by targeting sites in the 5.8S encoding gene. We evaluated the primers and compared their performance with the commonly used ITS1f primer by 454‐sequencing of both artificially assembled templates and field samples. When the entire ITS region was amplified using the ITS1f/ITS4 primer combination, we found strong bias against species with longer amplicons. This problem could be overcome by using the new primers, which produce shorter amplicons and better preserve the quantitative composition of the template. In addition, the new primers yielded more diverse amplicon communities than the ITS1f primer.},

abstract = {Compositional data are commonly used in chemical ecology to describe the biological role of chemical compounds in communication, defense or other behavioral modifications. Statistical analyses of compositional data, however, are challenging due to several constraints (e.g., constant sum constraint). We use an ontogenetic series of defensive gland secretions from larvae, three nymphal stages and adults of the oribatid model species Archegozetes longisetosus as a typical chemo-ecological data set to prepare a practical guide for compositional data analyses in chemical ecology. We compare various common and less common statistical and ordination methods to depict small quantitative and/or qualitative differences in compositional datasets: principal component analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), multivariate statistical tests (Anderson's permutational multivariate analyses of variance = PERMANOVA; permutational analyses of multivariate dispersions = PERMDIPS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the data mining algorithm Random Forests, bipartite network analysis and dynamic range boxes (dynRB). We summarize which methods are suitable for different research questions and how data needs to be structured and pre-processed. Network analyses and dynamic range boxes are promising tools for analyzing compositional data beyond the “classical” methods and provide additional information.},

abstract = {Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle-spinning3C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS13C NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterise semi-quantitatively the organic materials contained in particle size and density fractions isolated from five different mineral soils: two Mollisols, two Oxisols and an Andosol. The acquired spectra were analysed to determine the relative proportion of carboxyl, aromatic, O-alkyl and alkyl carbon contained in each fraction. Although similar types of carbon were present in all of the fractions analysed, an influence of both soil type and particle size was evident. The chemical structure of the organic materials contained in the particle size fractions isolated from the Andosol was similar; however, for the Mollisols and Oxisols, the content of O-alkyl, aromatic and alkyl carbon was greatest in the coarse, intermediate and fine fractions, respectively. The compositional differences noted in progressing from the coarser to finer particle size fractions in the Mollisols and Oxisols were consistent with the changes noted in other studies where CP/MAS13C NMR was used to monitor the decomposition of natural organic materials. Changes in the C:N ratio of the particle size fractions supported the proposal that the extent of decomposition of the organic materials contained in the fine fractions was greater than that contained in the coarse fractions. The increased content of aromatic and alkyl carbon in the intermediate size fractions could be explained completely by a selective preservation mechanism; however, the further accumulation of alkyl carbon in the clay fractions appeared to result from both a selective preservation and an in situ synthesis. The largest compositional differences noted for the entire organic fraction of the five soils were observed between soil orders. The differences within orders were smaller. The Mollisols and the Andosol were both dominated by O-alkyl carbon but the Andosol had a lower alkyl carbon content. The Oxisols were dominated by both O-alkyl and alkyl carbon. A model describing the oxidative decomposition of plant materials in mineral soils is proposed and used to explain the influence of soil order and particle size on the chemical composition of soil organic matter in terms of its extent of decomposition and bioavailability. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Environmental DNA was isolated from the mat, a clone library of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments was prepared, and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) was done to assign clones to seven groups. Low cyanobacterial diversity in the mat was suggested in that 83{\%} of the clones were represented by one ARDRA group. DNA sequences from this group had high similarity with 16S rRNA genes of Tychonema bourrellyi and T. bornetii isolates, whose geographic origins were southern Norway and Northern Ireland. Cyanobacterial morphotypes corresponding to Tychonema have not been reported in Antarctica, however, this morphotype was previously found at Ward Hunt Lake (83A(0)N), and in western Europe (52A(0)N). DNA sequences of three of the ARDRA groups had highest similarity with 16S rDNA sequences of the Tychonema group accounting for 9.4{\%} of the clones. Sequences of the remaining three groups (7.6{\%}) had highest similarity with 16S rRNA genes of uncultured cyanobacteria clones from benthic mats of Lake Fryxell and fresh meltwater on the McMurdo Ice Shelf.},

abstract = {The ability of microorganisms to use polyethylene as a carbon source has only been recently established. This result has significance both from an environmental point of view, due to the accumulation of millions of tons of waste plastics every year, but also regarding the conservation of integrity for infrastructures incorporating this plastic. A number of microorganisms with the ability to grow on polyethylene have been isolated. The effects of these microorganisms on the physiochemical properties of this polymer have been described; these include changes in crystallinity, molecular weight, topography of samples and the functional groups found on the surface. Although the bio-degradation and bio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several researchers, the enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these phenomena are still unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both enzymatic and abiotic factors (such UV light) can mediate the initial oxidation of polyethylene chains, and given the chemical similarity between polyethylene and olefins it has been suggested that the metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be used once the size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range for enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons). The long-range structure and morphology of polyethylene have shown important roles, with amorphous regions being more prone to microbial attack than crystalline ones. This review focuses on the recent hypotheses and experimental findings regarding the biodegradation of polyethylene. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural sorbents including one humic acid (HA), humins (HMs), nonhydrolyzable carbons (NHCs), and engineered sorbents (biochars) were subject to bleaching to selectively remove a fraction of aromatic C. The structural properties and sorption isotherm data of phenanthrene (Phen) by original and bleached sorbents were obtained. Significant correlations between Phen Koc values by all sorbents and their organic carbon (OC)-normalized CO2 cumulative surface area (CO2-SA/OC) suggested that nanopore-filling mechanism could dominate Phen sorption. After bleaching, natural sorbents still contained large amounts of aromatic C, which are resistant to bleaching, suggesting that they are derived from condensed or nonbiodegradable organic matter (OM). After eliminating the effect of aromatic C remaining in the bleached samples, a general trend of increasing CO2-SA/OC of natural sorbents with increasing aliphaticity was observed, suggesting that nanopores of natural sorbents are partially derived from their aliphatic moieties. Conversely, positive relationships between CO2-SA/OC or Phen logKoc of engineered sorbents and their aromaticity indicated the aromatic structures of engineered sorbents primarily contribute to their nanopores and dominate their sorption of HOCs. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrated that the role of structure and microporosity in Phen sorption is dependent on the sources of sorbents.},

abstract = {Current hypotheses link the bioavailability of contaminants in sediments to their partitioning behavior to organic matter in sediments. Because contaminant partitioning varies with sediment composition, it follows that composition should also affect contaminant bioavailability. In this study, Variations in dieldrin partitioning and bioavailability, as measured by organic carbon/lipid-normalized bioaccumulation factors for Lumbriculus variegatus, were related to sediment composition. Study sediments covered a wide range of composition and organic matter content. Normalizing the bioaccumulation factors to the organic carbon content of sediments and lipid content of organisms reduced ranges of measured dieldrin accumulation factors from 38-fold to 8-fold. Factors describing sediment composition we re tested to determine whether they explained the remaining variability between sediments. Variations in partitioning were best explained by the proportion of sedimentary organic matter that was solvent extractable. However, bioavailability correlated most strongly to pH. There was little correspondence between factors that explained variability in partitioning and those covarying with bioaccumulation.},

abstract = {Chloroflexi small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences are frequently recovered from subseafloor environments, but the metabolic potential of the phylum is poorly understood. The phylum Chloroflexi is represented by isolates with diverse metabolic strategies, including anoxic phototrophy, fermentation, and reductive dehalogenation; therefore, function cannot be attributed to these organisms based solely on phylogeny. Single-cell genomics can provide metabolic insights into uncultured organisms, like the deep-subsurface Chloroflexi. Nine SSU rRNA gene sequences were identified from single-cell sorts of whole-round core material collected from the Okinawa Trough at Iheya North hydrothermal field as part of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expedition 331 (Deep Hot Biosphere). Previous studies of subsurface Chloroflexi single amplified genomes (SAGs) suggested heterotrophic or lithotrophic metabolisms and provided no evidence for growth by reductive dehalogenation. Our nine Chloroflexi SAGs (seven of which are from the order Anaerolineales) indicate that, in addition to genes for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, exogenous carbon sources can be actively transported into cells. At least one subunit for pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase was found in four of the Chloroflexi SAGs. This protein can provide a link between the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and other carbon anabolic pathways. Finally, one of the seven Anaerolineales SAGs contains a distinct reductive dehalogenase homologous (rdhA) gene.},

abstract = {Low molecular weight organic substances (LMWOS) in soil and soil solution include mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and carbohydrates. Due to their high bioavailability they play a crucial role in the cycles of C and nutrients in soils. The variety of soil processes that involve LMWOS requires identifying their composition to elucidate reactions and transformations. In most studies, LMWOS are extracted under artificial conditions, e.g. batch experiments, which may overestimate the actual concentrations. This study measures the composition of carbohydrates and amino acids in solution of a Haplic Luvisol leached in a column experiment. A combined system for simultaneous leaching and blowout of CO2 was used to estimate LMWOS decomposition. 14C-labeled glucose was added as a highly sensitive tracer to control the efficiency of the LMWOS extraction by leaching and to estimate LMWOS decomposition during leaching. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), optimized for soil extracts, was used to analyze LMWOS composition. For HPLC optimization, different preparations of leached solutions (filtration vs. centrifugation, and drying vs. no-drying) were compared. For sugar determination, drying had no influence on the solution concentrations. In contrast, amino acid concentrations significantly decreased by drying LMWOS eluted substances. Combining the HPLC identification of eluted substances with 14C tracer application revealed that about 5{\%} of the glucose could be leached unchanged within 786 min (13.1 h), whereas about 84{\%} remained in the soil, 9{\%} were decomposed to CO2, and 2{\%} were transformed to other LMWOS and recovered in the soil solution. The total amino acid concentration (TAC) in soil solution was about 8.2 $\mu$mol l-1, dominated by alanine (14.4{\%} of TAC), glycine (13.4{\%}), glutamic acid (9.9{\%}), serine (9.4{\%}), and leucine (9.3{\%}). The total carbohydrate concentration was about 2.4 $\mu$M, dominated by glucose (29.9{\%}), glucuronic acid (26.8{\%}), and galacturonic acid (17.3{\%}). Ratios of hexoses to pentoses, amino sugars glucosamine to galactosamine, and neutral sugars to uronic acids were determined. All three parameters pointed to the dominant influence of plants as the source of LMWOS in the leached soil solution. Within the small contribution of microorganisms, bacteria dominated over fungi. These used biomarker ratios as well as LMWOS concentrations differed widely from the ones obtained with conventional batch extraction. More research is necessary to evaluate the application of these biomarkers to soil solutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal , a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn's microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study.  IMPORTANCE We propose a new algorithm for the identification of microbial signatures. These microbial signatures can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prediction of therapeutic response based on an individual's specific microbiota. },

abstract = {Rhizodeposition, i.e. the release of carbon into the soil by growing roots, is an important part of the terrestrial carbon cycle. However the in situ nature and dynamics of root-derived carbon in the soil are still poorly understood. Here we made an investigation of the latter in laboratory experiments using 13CO2 pulse chase labelling of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We analyzed the kinetics of 13C-labelled carbon and more specially 13C carbohydrates in the rhizosphere. Wheat seedlings-soil mesocosms were exposed to 13CO2 for 5 hours in controlled chambers and sampled repeatedly during two weeks for 13C/C analysis of organic carbon. After a two-step separation of the soil from the roots, the amount of total organic 13C was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry as well as the amounts of 13C in arabinose, fructose, fucose, glucose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose and xylose. The amount and isotopic ratio of monosaccharides were obtained by capillary gas chromatography coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) after trimethyl-silyl derivatization. Two fractions were analyzed : total (hydrolysable) and soluble monomeric (water extractable) soil sugars. The amount of organic 13C found in the soil, expressed as a percentage of the total photosynthetically fixed 13C at the end of the labelling period, reached 16{\%} in the day following labelling and stabilised at 9{\%} after one week. We concluded that glucose under the form of polymers was the dominant moietie of rhizodeposits. Soluble glucose and fructose were also present. But after 2 days, these soluble sugars had disappeared. Forty percent of the root-derived carbon was in the form of neutral sugars, and exhibited a time-increasing signature of microbial sugars. The composition of rhizospheric sugars rapidly tended towards that of bulk soil organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

We discuss emerging graph theoretical concepts and approaches used in other research disciplines and demonstrate how they are well suited for enhancing our understanding of the higher-order interactions that occur within microbiomes. Network-based analytical approaches have the potential to help disentangle complex polymicrobial and microbe–host interactions, and thereby further the applicability of microbiome research to personalized medicine, public health, environmental and industrial applications, and agriculture.},

MRT forms clusters of sites by repeated splitting of the data, with each split defined by a simple rule based on environmental values. The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dissimilarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the environmental data are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environmental data are available. MRT is compared with redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis using simulated data and a field data set.},

Using a natural 13C tracer method to separately measure SOM-derived CO2 from root-derived CO2, this study aims to connect the level of rhizosphere-dependent SOM decomposition with the C and N balance of the whole plant–soil system, and to mechanistically link the rhizosphere priming effect to soil microbial turnover and evapotranspiration. Results indicated that the magnitude of the rhizosphere priming effect on SOM decomposition varied widely, from zero to more than 380{\%} of the unplanted control, and was largely influenced by plant species and phenology. Balancing the extra soil C loss from the strong rhizosphere priming effect in the planted treatments with C inputs from rhizodeposits and root biomass, the whole plant–soil system remained with a net carbon gain at the end of the experiment. The increased soil microbial biomass turnover rate and the enhanced evapotranspiration rate in the planted treatments had clear positive relationships with the level of the rhizosphere priming effect. The rhizosphere enhancement of soil carbon mineralization in the planted treatments did not result in a proportional increase in net N mineralization, suggesting a possible de-coupling of C cycling with N cycling in the rhizosphere.},

Desorption and biodegradation of a-HCH in mixed soil suspensions at 20 "C were shown to be controlled by intraparticle mass-transfer processes. Two models were applied to the desorption and biodegradation kinetic data, a first-order model (FOM) and a sorption-retarded radial diffusion model (RDM). Only the RDM could explain the effect of aggregate size on HCH desorption and bioconversion rate. It also yielded the best fit to the desorption kinetic data. Estimated effective diffusivities were in the order of 5 X lo-'' m2/s. Biodegradation kinetics of a-HCH could only be described by the RDM by assuming that microorganisms could penetrate the inner parts of the aggregates.},

abstract = {Many studies have explored the mechanisms involved in relative amino acid usage (RAAU) in a variety of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. A strong bias was observed in highly expressed genes (HEGs) of endosymbiotic bacteria. By means of correspondence analysis, we studied the major trends affecting internal variability of RAAU in Mollicutes. The principal trend is related to the usage of smaller, less aromatic, and GC-rich coded amino acids in HEGs. Given the nature of the genetic code, these properties are linked among them. Expectedly, we found a slow evolutionary rate of HEGs, which is likely driven by purifying selection. On the other hand, the rest of the genes accumulate rapid changes as a result of the extreme mutational bias toward A+T of the genomes and genetic drift, increasing internal variability. Amino acid changes across the phylogeny of the group were traced in order to estimate the mean molecular weight and aromaticity trends in each branch. Finally, we compared amino acid usage bias within and between Mollicutes and the free-living Firmicutes.},

A database of soil C:N ratios was constructed and subdivided into biome types. At a global scale, mean soil C:N ratio of a biome accounts for 99.2{\%} of the variance in annual riverine DOC flux among biomes. The relationship between soil C:N ratio and DOC flux at the biome scale was used to predict annual riverine DOC flux at the watershed scale for three test watersheds not included in the original model. Predicted flux of each watershed was within 4.5{\%} of the actual DOC flux. Using the C:N model, we estimated the total export of carbon from land to the oceans to be 3.6 × 1014 g yr-1. This empirical model should be useful in predicting changes in DOC flux under changing climatic conditions.},

DDT-1 based on morphological characteristics, BIOLOG GN2 microplate profile, and 16S rDNA phylogeny. Genome sequencing and functional annotation of the isolate DDT-1 showed a 4,514,569 bp genome size, 66.92{\%} GC content, 4,033 protein-coding genes, and 76 RNA genes including 8 rRNA genes. Totally, 2,807 protein-coding genes were assigned to Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), and 1,601 protein-coding genes were mapped to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. The degradation half-lives of DDT increased with substrate concentration from 0.1 to 10.0 mg/l, whereas decreased with temperature from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C. Neutral condition was the most favorable for DDT biodegradation. Based on genome annotation of DDT degradation genes and the metabolites detected by GC-MS, a mineralization pathway was proposed for DDT biodegradation in which it was orderly converted into DDE/DDD, DDMU, DDOH, and DDA via dechlorination, hydroxylation, and carboxylation, and ultimately mineralized to carbon dioxide. The results indicate that the isolate DDT-1 is a promising bacterial resource for the removal or detoxification of DDT residues in the environment.},

abstract = {One thermophilic (strain IMO-1T) and two mesophilic (strains KIBI-1T and YMTK-2T) non-spore-forming, non-motile, Gram-negative, multicellular filamentous micro-organisms, which were previously isolated as members of the tentatively named class 'Anaerolineae' of the phylum Chloroflexi, were characterized. All isolates were strictly anaerobic micro-organisms. The length of the three filamentous isolates was greater than 100 $\mu$m and the width was 0.3-0.4 $\mu$m for strain IMO-1T, 0.4-0.5 $\mu$m for strain KIBI-1T and thinner than 0.2 $\mu$m for strain YMTK-2T. Strain IMO-1T could grow at pH 6.0-7.5 (optimum growth at pH 7.0). The optimal temperature for growth of strain IMO-1T was around 50 °C (growth occurred between 42 and 55 °C). Growth of the mesophilic strains KIBI-1T and YMTK-2T occurred at pH 6.0-7.2 with optimal growth at pH 7.0. Both of the mesophilic strains were able to grow in a temperature range of 25-50 °C with optimal growth at around 37 °C. Yeast extract was required for growth of all three strains. All the strains could grow with a number of carbohydrates in the presence of yeast extract. The G+C contents of the DNA of strains IMO-1T, KIBI-1T and YMTK-2T were respectively 53.3, 59.5 and 48.2 mol{\%}. Major fatty acids for thermophilic strain IMO-1T were anteiso-C17:0, iso-C15:0, C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0, whereas those for mesophilic strains KIBI-1T and YMTK-2T were branched C14:0, iso-C15:0, C16:0 and branched C17:0, and branched C17:0, C16:0, C14:0 and C17:0, respectively. Detailed phylogenetic analyses based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolates belong to the class-level taxon 'Anaerolineae' of the bacterial phylum Chloroflexi, which for a long time had been considered as a typical uncultured clone cluster. Their morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and genetic traits strongly support the conclusion that these strains should be described as three novel independent taxa in the phylum Chloroflexi. Here, Anaerolinea thermolimosa sp. nov. (type strain IMO-1T=JCM 12577T=DSM 16554T), Levilinea saccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain KIBI-1T=JCM 12578T=DSM 16555T) and Leptolinea tardivitalis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain YMTK-2T= JCM 12579T=DSM 16556T) are proposed. In addition, we formally propose to subdivide the tentative class-level taxon 'Anaerolineae' into Anaerolineae classis nov. and Caldilineae classis nov. We also propose the subordinate taxa Anaerolineales ord. nov., Caldilineales ord. nov., Anaerolineaceae fam. nov. and Caldilineaceae fam. nov. {\textcopyright} 2006 IUMS.},

They belong to the group of chlorinated hydrocarbon derivatives, which have vast application in the chemical industry and in agriculture. These compounds are known for their high toxicity, slow degradation and bioaccumulation. Even though many of the compounds which belong to OC were banned in developed countries, the use of these agents has been rising. This concerns particularly abuse of these chemicals which is in practice across the continents. Though pesticides have been developed with the concept of target organism toxicity, often non-target species are affected badly by their application. The purpose of this review is to list the major classes of pesticides, to understand organochlorine pesticides based on their activity and persistence, and also to understand their biochemical toxicity.},

abstract = {Understanding microbial community structure and diversity in contaminated soils helps optimize the bioremediation strategies and performance. This study investigated the roles of environmental variables and contamination levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in shaping microbial community structure at an abandoned aged insecticide plant site. In total, 28 bacterial phyla were identified across soils with different physiochemical properties and OCPs levels. Proteobacteria, Bacterioidetes and Firmicutes represented the dominant lineages, and accounted for 60.2{\%}–69.2{\%}, 5.6{\%}–9.7{\%} and 6.7{\%}–9.4{\%} of the total population, respectively. The overall microbial diversities, in terms of phylogenetic diversity and phylotype richness, were correlated with the contents of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) in soils, as well as other soil properties including total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, pH and vegetation. The multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis revealed that the soil microbial diversity was significantly impacted by vegetation, which explained 31.8{\%} of the total variation, followed by OCPs level (28.3{\%}), total nitrogen (12.4{\%}), dissolved organic carbon (6.3{\%}) and pH (2.4{\%}). Our findings provide new insights and implications into the impacts on soil microbial community by OCPs contamination and other environmental variables, and offer potential strategic bioremediation for the management of OCPs contaminated sites.},

Under aqueous culture conditions, the strain IITR03 degraded 282. $\mu$M of DDT and could also utilize 10. mM concentration each of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-chlorobenzoic acid and benzoic acid as sole carbon and energy source. The catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme activity resulted in conversion of catechol to form cis,cis-muconic acid. Cloning and sequencing of partial nucleotide sequence of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene (cat) from strain IITR03 revealed its similarity to catA gene present in Rhodococcus sp. strain Lin-2 (97{\%} identity) and Rhodococcus strain AN22 (96{\%} identity) degrading benzoate and aniline, respectively.

abstract = {In situ anaerobic bioremediation of chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethene (PCE) frequently faces the problem of accumulating toxic, lower chlorinated compounds such as dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). In the present study, the efficacy of the sequential application of electron donors, supporting reductive dechlorination, and of humic acids, acting as extracellular electron shuttles facilitating the anaerobic oxidation of recalcitrant intermediates, was explored in microcosm studies. Upon one initial dose of lactose, supplied in a 1000-fold superstoichiometric electron equivalent ratio, PCE was completely converted into cis-DCE within 35. days. Repeated electron donor additions did not entail exhaustive cis-DCE degradation over incubation time (120. days). Although the electron donor was quickly converted into fatty acids, about 30{\%} of added reducing equivalents were recovered as acetate after four months of operation, indicating the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis. In the next step, the substoichiometric addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, a humic acid model compound, effected the complete removal of the accumulated cis-DCE within 15. days, probably as a result of the participation of the quinone in the biotic or abiotic anaerobic oxidation of cis-DCE. Cis-DCE degradation was not connected to the accumulation of VC, rendering the proposed two-step treatment an efficient and environmentally compliant remedy for anaerobic groundwater bodies contaminated with chlorinated solvents. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Pesticides are used for controlling the develop-ment of various pests in agricultural crops worldwide. Despite their agricultural benefits, pesticides are often considered a serious threat to the environment because of their persistent nature and the anomalies they create. Hence removal of such pesticides from the environment is a topic of interest for the researchers nowadays. During the recent years, use of biological resources to degrade or remove pesticides has emerged as a powerful tool for their in situ degradation and remediation. Fungi are among such bioresources that have been widely characterized and applied for biodegradation and bioremediation of pes-ticides. This review article presents the perspectives of using fungi for biodegradation and bioremediation of pes-ticides in liquid and soil media. This review clearly indicates that fungal isolates are an effective bioresource to degrade different pesticides including lindane, methamidophos, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, atrazine, cypermethrin, dieldrin, methyl parathion, heptachlor, etc. However, rate of fungal degradation of pesticides depends on soil moisture content, nutrient availability, pH, temper-ature, oxygen level, etc. Fungal strains were found to harbor different processes including hydroxylation, de-methylation, dechlorination, dioxygenation, esterification, dehydrochlorination, oxidation, etc during the biodegrada-tion of different pesticides having varying functional groups. Moreover, the biodegradation of different pesti-cides was found to be mediated by involvement of differ-ent enzymes including laccase, hydrolase, peroxidase, es-terase, dehydrogenase, manganese peroxidase, lignin per-oxidase, etc. The recent advances in understanding the fungal biodegradation of pesticides focusing on the pro-cesses, pathways, genes/enzymes and factors affecting the biodegradation have also been presented in this review article.},

abstract = {In this review, the strategies being employed to exploit the inherent durability of biofilms and the diverse nutrient cycling of the microbiome for bioremediation are explored. Focus will be given to halogenated compounds, hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products as well as some heavy metals and toxic minerals, as these groups represent the majority of priority pollutants. For decades, industrial processes have been creating waste all around the world, resulting in contaminated sediments and subsequent, far-reaching dispersal into aquatic environments. As persistent pollutants have accumulated and are still being created and disposed, the incentive to find suitable and more efficient solutions to effectively detoxify the environment is even greater. Indigenous bacterial communities are capable of metabolizing persistent organic pollutants and oxidizing heavy metal contaminants. However, their low abundance and activity in the environment, difficulties accessing the contaminant or nutrient limitations in the environment all prevent the processes from occurring as quickly as desired and thus reaching the proposed clean-up goals. Biofilm communities provide among other things a beneficial structure, possibility for nutrient, and genetic exchange to participating microorganisms as well as protection from the surrounding environment concerning for instance predation and chemical and shear stresses. Biofilms can also be utilized in other ways as biomarkers for monitoring of stream water quality from for instance mine drainage. The durability and structure of biofilms together with the diverse array of structural and metabolic characteristics make these communities attractive actors in biofilm-mediated remediation solutions and ecosystem monitoring.},

abstract = {Background: In the context of systems biology, few sparse approaches have been proposed so far to integrate several data sets. It is however an important and fundamental issue that will be widely encountered in post genomic studies, when simultaneously analyzing transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data using different platforms, so as to understand the mutual interactions between the different data sets. In this high dimensional setting, variable selection is crucial to give interpretable results. We focus on a sparse Partial Least Squares approach (sPLS) to handle two-block data sets, where the relationship between the two types of variables is known to be symmetric. Sparse PLS has been developed either for a regression or a canonical correlation framework and includes a built-in procedure to select variables while integrating data. To illustrate the canonical mode approach, we analyzed the NCI60 data sets, where two different platforms (cDNA and Affymetrix chips) were used to study the transcriptome of sixty cancer cell lines. Results: We compare the results obtained with two other sparse or related canonical correlation approaches: CCA with Elastic Net penalization (CCA-EN) and Co-Inertia Analysis (CIA). The latter does not include a built-in procedure for variable selection and requires a two-step analysis. We stress the lack of statistical criteria to evaluate canonical correlation methods, which makes biological interpretation absolutely necessary to compare the different gene selections. We also propose comprehensive graphical representations of both samples and variables to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Conclusion: sPLS and CCA-EN selected highly relevant genes andcomplementary findings from the two data sets, which enabled a detailed understanding of the molecular characteristics of several groups of cell lines. These two approaches were found to bring similar results, although they highlighted the same phenomenons with a different priority. They outperformed CIA that tended to select redundant information. {\textcopyright} 2009 L{\^{e}} Cao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {California grasslands experience major seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall which may affect the microbial processing of nitrogen (N), a growth-limiting soil resource. While N cycling dynamics during the growing season (fall, winter, and spring) are well-studied in California grasslands, details about summer N cycling are scarce, presumably because researchers assume that nothing biologically important happens in soils during the hot, dry summer months when grasses are dead or dormant. However, studying soil N dynamics over the summer is crucial to understanding soil N availability at the beginning of the subsequent growing season. To characterize the differences between summertime and growing season N availability and microbial processing of N, we compared N pool sizes, rates of N mineralization, potential nitrification, potential denitrification, and microbial biomass during the dry non-growing season (late spring and summer) with those of the moist growing season (fall, winter, and early spring) in a California grassland. Many of the patterns we observed differed from our expectations; net mineralization, both nitrification and denitrification potentials, and microbial biomass all increased during summer. Our findings raise questions about the controls on N cycling in Mediterranean-type grassland ecosystems where plant productivity is controlled by rainfall, and suggest a greater level of complexity in the mechanisms behind N cycling dynamics in California grasslands than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study was performed to reveal the microbial community characteristics in simulated managed aquifer recharge (MAR), a natural water treatment system, under different concentrations and compositions of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and further link these to the biotransformation of emerging trace organic chemicals (TOrCs). Two pairs of soil-column setups were established in the laboratory receiving synthetic feed solutions composed of different peptone/humic acid ratios and concentrations. Higher BDOC concentration resulted in lower microbial community diversity and higher relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria. Decreasing the peptone/humic acid ratio resulted in higher diversity of the community and higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria. The metabolic capabilities of microbiome involved in xenobiotics biodegradation were significantly promoted under lower BDOC concentration and higher humic acid content. Cytochrome P450 genes were also more abundant under these primary substrate conditions. Lower peptone/humic acid ratios also promoted the attenuation of most TOrCs. These results suggest that the primary substrate characterized by a more refractory character could increase the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria, as well as associated cytochrome P450 genes, all of which should play important roles in the biotransformation of TOrCs in this natural treatment system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background and AimsA comprehensive understanding of the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) on the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) requires an integration of many factors. It is unclear how N form-induced change in soil pH affects the RPE and SOC sequestration.MethodsThis study compared the change in the RPE under supply of NO3-N and NH4-N. The effect of the RPE on the mineralization of soil N and hence its availability to plant and microbes was also examined using a 15N-labelled N source.Key ResultsThe supply of NH4-N decreased rhizosphere pH by 0.16–0.38 units, and resulted in a decreased or negative RPE. In contrast, NO3-N nutrition increased rhizosphere pH by 0.19–0.78 units, and led to a persistently positive RPE. The amounts of rhizosphere-primed C were positively correlated with rhizosphere pH. Rhizosphere pH affected the RPE mainly through influencing microbial biomass, activity and utilization of root exudates, and the availability of SOC to microbes. Furthermore, the amount of rhizosphere primed C correlated negatively with microbial biomass atom{\%} 15N (R2 0.77–0.98, n = 12), suggesting that microbes in the rhizosphere acted as the immediate sink for N released from enhanced SOC decomposition via the RPE.ConclusionN form was an important factor affecting the magnitude and direction of the RPE via its effect on rhizosphere pH. Rhizosphere pH needs to be considered in SOC and RPE modelling.},

Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference. We developed a taxonomy to tree approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408 315 sequences. We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency. The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75{\%} of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups. All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download. The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project).

abstract = {The influence of the composition of added organic C on microbial functional diversity was investigated in an arable soil. Soil was treated with single large additions of organic C compounds (asparagine, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, mannose, methyl-glucamine and urocanic acid) or repeated additions of compounds (asparagine, glucosamine, $\alpha$-ketovaleric acid or urocanic acid) over 4 d. The effects on microbial functional diversity were assessed by measurement of patterns of in situ catabolic potential (ISCP) in each experiment at 1, 7 and 20 weeks, and 1, 4 and 7 d, respectively. Microbial biomass C was generally increased by the substrate additions in both experiments and remained greater than the control over 7 d in the repeated-addition experiment. After 20 weeks, however, only the microbial biomass C in the asparagine and mannose treatments remained increased in the single-addition experiment. The direction of changes in the patterns of ISCP were distinctly different between most treatments in both the single- and repeated-substrate addition experiments. Over 20 weeks, factor analysis showed that the patterns of ISCP in the glutamic acid, mannose, methyl-glucamine and urocanic acid treatments tended to converge with that in the non-amended treatment. The changes in patterns of ISCP were also different after repeated additions of different substrates. However, respiration responses to the added substrate in each of the treatments were not specifically increased relative to the respiration responses to other organic C compounds. These results support the hypothesis that addition of different types of organic C can influence patterns of ISCP. However, it is difficult to distinguish the direct effects of the added compounds on the respiration response to individual substrates.},

Herein we evaluated the linkage between microbial functional genes and extracellular enzyme activity in soil samples collected across three geographical regions of Australia. We found a strong relationship between different functional genes and their corresponding enzyme activities. This relationship was maintained after considering microbial community structure, total C and soil pH using structural equation modelling. Results showed that the variations in the activity of enzymes involved in C degradation were predicted by the functional gene abundance of the soil microbial community (R 2 {\textgreater}0.90 in all cases). Our findings provide a strong framework for improved predictions on soil C dynamics that could be achieved by adopting a gene-centric approach incorporating the abundance of functional genes into process models.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous soil pollutants. The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. 13C-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in 13C-SIP incubations compared to 12C-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of 13C-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation. Active PHE-degraders act in a consortium, whereby complete PHE mineralization is achieved through the combined activity of taxonomically diverse co-occurring bacteria performing successive metabolic steps. Our study reveals hitherto underestimated functional interactions for full microbial detoxification in contaminated soils.},

The hypothesis tested was that the coelution of non-target compounds may lead to false positives when analyzed by GC–ECD, and that the overestimation associated with these false positives can be eliminated using GC–NCI-MS. The study showed that both methods had satisfactory linearity and reproducibility for the target compounds. Although the sensitivities of GC–ECD for most of the compounds investigated were higher than those observed with the GC–NCI-MS method, the matrices interference was obvious with GC–ECD. There was indeed an apparently high false-positive rate or overestimate when GC–ECD was used for environmental samples, implying that the GC–ECD method has been used with care and that GC–NCI-MS is generally superior for the analysis of trace amounts of these compounds in environmental samples. Based on these results, the sample extraction and cleanup procedures of the GC–NCI-MS method were optimized for achieving acceptable recoveries and less matrices interference.},

abstract = {A pressure-chamber technique was used to study the root uptake and xylem translocation of some fungicides, herbicides and an insecticide from different chemical classes in detopped soybean roots. Physiological parameters such as K+ leakage from roots, K+ concentrations in the xylem sap, and protein and ATP levels in the root cells were measured so as to evaluate any potential damage of this technique to the root system. HPLC was used to quantify the compounds in the xylem sap. The pressure-chamber technique has proved useful to study the root uptake and translocation of pesticides, does not damage the root system, and allows one to obtain appreciable volumes of xylem sap that can be analysed directly by HPLC, thus avoiding dependence on the availability of radio-labelled compounds. The concentration of each pesticide in the xylem sap showed a steady-state kinetic profile. Non-linear regression analysis was used to calculate the steady-state concentration and the time required to achieve 50{\%} of the steady-state concentration (TSSC50). TSSC50 was well correlated with log K-ow; the more lipophilic the compound the more time was required to reach the steady-state concentration. The efficiency of translocation was assessed by the transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) and a non-linear relationship between TSCF and log K-ow was observed. The highest TSCF values were measured for those compounds with log K-ow values around 3, a lipophilicity value similar to that reported earlier in an analogous experiment with detopped soybean plants but slightly higher than that reported in earlier experiments with intact barley plants. Lower TSCF values were obtained with chemicals with log K-ow values below as well as above 3.},

abstract = {During the rapid mineralization in soil of sucralose (4-chloro-4-deoxy-$\alpha$,D-galactopyranosyl-1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-$\beta$,D-fructofuranoside), a metabolic product was formed that appears to be the corresponding unsaturated aldehyde. During the slow and incomplete mineralization of sucralose in lake water, which was not increased by the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus, the same compound was produced. That product was further metabolized by microorganisms in lake water and soil. Mineralization was also slow in sewage under aerobic conditions, but organic products were not detected. Little or no CO2 was formed from the disaccharide in flooded soil or anaerobic sewage. Bacteria in culture did not use sucralose as a carbon source but did convert it to the presumed unsaturated aldehyde, 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-D-fructose and possibly the uronic acid of sucralose. Sucralose carbon was not incorporated into cells of two sucralose-metabolizing bacteria or the microbial biomass of sewage or lake water. The chlorinated disaccharide was slowly metabolized by a galactose oxidase preparation. It is concluded that the chlorinated sugar is acted on microbiologically by cometabolism. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background and AimsA comprehensive understanding of the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) on the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) requires an integration of many factors. It is unclear how N form-induced change in soil pH affects the RPE and SOC sequestration.MethodsThis study compared the change in the RPE under supply of NO3-N and NH4-N. The effect of the RPE on the mineralization of soil N and hence its availability to plant and microbes was also examined using a 15N-labelled N source.Key ResultsThe supply of NH4-N decreased rhizosphere pH by 0.16–0.38 units, and resulted in a decreased or negative RPE. In contrast, NO3-N nutrition increased rhizosphere pH by 0.19–0.78 units, and led to a persistently positive RPE. The amounts of rhizosphere-primed C were positively correlated with rhizosphere pH. Rhizosphere pH affected the RPE mainly through influencing microbial biomass, activity and utilization of root exudates, and the availability of SOC to microbes. Furthermore, the amount of rhizosphere primed C correlated negatively with microbial biomass atom{\%} 15N (R2 0.77–0.98, n = 12), suggesting that microbes in the rhizosphere acted as the immediate sink for N released from enhanced SOC decomposition via the RPE.ConclusionN form was an important factor affecting the magnitude and direction of the RPE via its effect on rhizosphere pH. Rhizosphere pH needs to be considered in SOC and RPE modelling.},

These were analyzed for PFAS, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant of the detected PFAS. Trophic levels and food web transfer of PFAS were determined using stable nitrogen isotopes ($\delta$15N). No correlation was found between PFOS concentrations and trophic level within species. However, a non-linear relationship was established when the entire food web was analyzed. Biomagnification factors displayed values {\textgreater}1 for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), PFOS and $\Sigma$PFAS(7).

abstract = {The use of aldrin and dieldrin as pesticides was prohibited in 1975 in Japan. However, some of the soils still remain contaminated with dieldrin, because aldrin is easily oxidized to dieldrin and dieldrin is extremely stable in soil. In recent years, dieldrin at concentrations exceeding the limit set by the Food Sanitation Law of Japan (dieldrin 0.02 mg kg-1 fresh weight) has been detected in cucumber fruits produced in some areas of Japan. We examined the effect of the soil application of selected adsorbents on reducing dieldrin concentrations in cucumber fruits in three steps of pot experiments. Among the three types of biochar made from wood chip, rice husk, and bamboo, wood chip charcoal was found to be the most effective (pot experiment 1). The effect of wood chip charcoal was enhanced by high-temperature burning and crushing (pot experiment 2). However, the effect of activated carbon was superior to that of optimized (high-temperature-treated and crushed) wood chip charcoal (pot experiment 3). Therefore, activated carbon was selected as the most effective adsorbent. The effect of activated carbon to reduce dieldrin concentrations in cucumber fruits was confirmed in a field experiment, and the effect continued to a certain extent for at least four years after the application. We calculated the cost of activated carbon necessary to maintain a sufficient suppressive effect in the field, and this cost would appear to be acceptable to cucumber farmers. Consequently, application of activated carbon to dieldrin-contaminated soils can be considered a promising practical technique for reducing dieldrin concentrations in cucumber fruits.},

abstract = {Storage conditions are considered to be a critical component of DNA-based microbial community analysis methods. However, whether differences in short-term sample storage conditions impact the assessment of bacterial community composition and diversity requires systematic and quantitative assessment. Therefore, we used barcoded pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to survey communities, harvested from a variety of habitats [soil, human gut (feces) and human skin] and subsequently stored at 20, 4, -20 and -80 °C for 3 and 14 days. Our results indicate that the phylogenetic structure and diversity of communities in individual samples were not significantly influenced by the storage temperature or the duration of storage. Likewise, the relative abundances of most taxa were largely unaffected by temperature even after 14 days of storage. Our results indicate that environmental factors and biases in molecular techniques likely confer greater amounts of variation to microbial communities than do differences in short-term storage conditions, including storage for up to 2 weeks at room temperature. These results suggest that many samples collected and stored under field conditions without refrigeration may be useful for microbial community analyses. {\textcopyright} 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The prevalence of the ED pathway is puzzling as it produces only one ATP per glucose - half as much as the EMP pathway. We argue that the diversity of prokaryotic glucose metabolism may reflect a tradeoff between a pathway's energy (ATP) yield and the amount of enzymatic protein required to catalyze pathway flux. We introduce methods for analyzing pathways in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics and show that the ED pathway is expected to require several-fold less enzymatic protein to achieve the same glucose conversion rate as the EMP pathway. Through genomic analysis, we further show that prokaryotes use different glycolytic pathways depending on their energy supply. Specifically, energy-deprived anaerobes over-whelmingly rely upon the higher ATP yield of the EMP pathway, whereas the ED pathway is common among facultative anaerobes and even more common among aerobes. In addition to demonstrating how protein costs can explain the use of alternative metabolic strategies, this study illustrates a direct connection between an organism's environment and the thermodynamic and biochemical properties of the metabolic pathways it employs.},

abstract = {Background: Variable selection on high throughput biological data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), becomes inevitable to select relevant information and, therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic structure. There are different ways to perform variable selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly used to identify differentially expressed features for explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits.Results: A simple extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass classification framework.Conclusions: sPLS-DA has a classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and SNP data sets. More importantly, sPLS-DA is clearly competitive in terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs. sPLS-DA is available in the R package mixOmics, which is dedicated to the analysis of large biological data sets. {\textcopyright} 2011 L{\^{e}} Cao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Microbiome sequencing data often need to be normalized due to differences in read depths, and recommendations for microbiome analyses generally warn against using proportions or rarefying to normalize data and instead advocate alternatives, such as upper quartile, CSS, edgeR-TMM, or DESeq-VS. Those recommendations are, however, based on studies that focused on differential abundance testing and variance standardization, rather than community-level comparisons (i.e., beta diversity). Also, standardizing the within-sample variance across samples may suppress differences in species evenness, potentially distorting community-level patterns. Furthermore, the recommended methods use log transformations, which we expect to exaggerate the importance of differences among rare OTUs, while suppressing the importance of differences among common OTUs. We tested these theoretical predictions via simulations and a real-world dataset. Proportions and rarefying produced more accurate comparisons among communities and were the only methods that fully normalized read depths across samples. Additionally, upper quartile, CSS, edgeR-TMM, and DESeq-VS often masked differences among communities when common OTUs differed, and they produced false positives when rare OTUs differed. Based on our simulations, normalizing via proportions may be superior to other commonly used methods for comparing ecological communities.},

abstract = {Background and aims Plants grown under elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) demand more nitrogen from soil and invest more labile carbon (C) compounds into below-ground. This would potentially affect microbial decomposition of soil organic C (SOC) in the rhizosphere- namely rhizosphere priming effect (RPE). This study aims to reveal how eCO(2) and nitrogen (N) supply affect the RPEs under wheat and white lupin. Methods Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L. cv. Kiev) were grown at two N addition rates under ambient CO2 (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and eCO(2) (800 mu mol mol(-1)) for 32 and 52 days in a C4 soil. Rhizosphere priming of SOC was quantified using the stable C-13 isotopic tracing technique. Results Relative to adequate N supply, low N increased the RPEs under both species at Day 32, but decreased the RPEs under wheat while had no effect on RPE under white lupin at Day 52. Elevated CO2 increased the RPE except that under wheat at Day 52. Conclusions Low N availability in soil increased the RPE probably via stimulated microbial N mining while eCO(2) and severe N limitation synergistically decreased the RPE under wheat but not under N-2-fixing white lupin.},

We stress that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO 2 . Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others. A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation, practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers, through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by agricultural practices, that require in-depth research.},

The capacity of the mixed agents to solubilize lindane, lead and cadmium in aqueous solution was also explored. The results showed that the presence of citric acid greatly enhanced the solubilization of lindane and cadmium by rhamnolipids. A combined effect of the mixed agents on lindane and heavy metals removal from soils was observed. The maximum desorption ratios for lindane, cadmium and lead were 85.4{\%}, 76.4{\%} and 28.1{\%}, respectively, for the mixed agents containing 1{\%} rhamnolipidsand 0.1 mol/L citric acid. The results also suggest that the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium were strongly related to their speciations in soils, and metals in the exchangeable and carbonate forms were easier to be removed. Our study suggests that the combining use of rhamnolipids and citric acid is a promising alternative to simultaneously remove organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals from soils.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to determine the sequence and relative abundance of all nucleotides in a biological or environmental sample. A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared. RESULTS: Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data. CONCLUSIONS: In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, "Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?"},

abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.},

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled novel insights into microbial niche differentiation, from analyzing environmental samples to understanding human diseases and informing dietary studies. However, identifying the microbial taxa that differentiate these samples can be challenging. These issues stem from the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data (or, more generally, taxon or functional gene data); the changes in the relative abundance of one taxon influence the apparent abundances of the others. Here we acknowledge that inferring properties of individual bacteria is a difficult problem and instead introduce the concept of balances to infer meaningful properties of subcommunities, rather than properties of individual species. We show that balances can yield insights about niche differentiation across multiple microbial environments, including soil environments and lung sputum. These techniques have the potential to reshape how we carry out future ecological analyses aimed at revealing differences in relative taxonomic abundances across different samples. IMPORTANCE By explicitly accounting for the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data through the concept of balances, balance trees yield novel biological insights into niche differentiation.

abstract = {A chromium (Cr)-resistant bacterium isolated from soil containing 6,000 mg/kg of Cr was identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as Delftia, and designated as JD2. Growth of JD2 was accompanied with reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in liquid medium initially containing 100 mg/L Cr(VI), the maximum concentration allowing growth. JD2 showed NADH/NADPH-dependent reductase activity associated with the soluble fraction of cells. The results suggest that JD2 might be a good candidate for the treatment of highly Cr(VI)-contaminated water and/or industrial effluents. The isolate produced indole-3-acetic acid in the presence and absence of Cr(VI) and showed free-living nitrogen-fixing activity possibly attributable to a V-nitrogenase. JD2 did not counteract the harmful effect of Cr(VI) during leguminous plant growth and nodulation by rhizobial strains but functioned as a "helper" bacterium to enhance the performance of rhizobial inoculant strains during inoculation of alfalfa and clover (used as model plants to study plant growth-promoting activity) in the absence of Cr(VI).},

abstract = {Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed scientists to probe increasingly complex biological systems, including the diversity of bacteria in the environment. However, despite a multitude of recent studies incorporating these methods, many questions regarding how environmental samples should be collected and stored still persist. Here, we assess the impact of different soil storage conditions on microbial community composition using Illumina-based 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequencing. Both storage time and temperature affected bacterial community composition and structure. Frozen samples maintained the highest alpha diversity and differed least in beta diversity, suggesting the utility of cold storage for maintaining consistent communities. Samples stored for intermediate times (three and seven days) had both the highest alpha diversity and the largest differences in overall beta diversity, showing the degree of community change after sample collection. These divergences notwithstanding, differences in neither storage time nor storage temperature substantially altered overall communities relative to more than 500 previously examined soil samples. These results systematically support previous studies and stress the importance of methodological consistency for accurate characterization and comparison of soil microbiological assemblages.},

While this approach has potential to reveal ecological processes, it has been insufficiently validated due to the technical limitations inherent in studying complex microbial ecosystems. Here, we simulate multi-species microbial communities with known interaction patterns using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics. We then construct co-occurrence networks and evaluate how well networks reveal the underlying interactions and how experimental and ecological parameters can affect network inference and interpretation. We find that co-occurrence networks can recapitulate interaction networks under certain conditions, but that they lose interpretability when the effects of habitat filtering become significant. We demonstrate that networks suffer from local hot spots of spurious correlation in the neighborhood of hub species that engage in many interactions. We also identify topological features associated with keystone species in co-occurrence networks. This study provides a substantiated framework to guide environmental microbiologists in the construction and interpretation of co-occurrence networks from microbial survey datasets.},

abstract = {The soil with petroleum contamination is one of the most studied soil ecosystems due to its rich microorganisms for hydrocarbon degradation and broad applications in bioremediation. However, our understanding of the genomic properties and functional traits of the soil microbiome is limited. In this study, we used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to comprehensively study the microbial community from petroleum-contaminated soils near Tianjin Dagang oilfield in eastern China. The analysis reveals that the soil metagenome is characterized by high level of community diversity and metabolic versatility. The metageome community is predominated by $\gamma$-Proteobacteria and $\alpha$-Proteobacteria, which are key players for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation. The functional study demonstrates over-represented enzyme groups and pathways involved in degradation of a broad set of xenobiotic aromatic compounds, including toluene, xylene, chlorobenzoate, aminobenzoate, DDT, methylnaphthalene, and bisphenol. A composite metabolic network is proposed for the identified pathways, thus consolidating our identification of the pathways. The overall data demonstrated the great potential of the studied soil microbiome in the xenobiotic aromatics degradation. The results not only establish a rich reservoir for novel enzyme discovery but also provide putative applications in bioremediation.},

abstract = {Low molecular weight organic substances (LMWOS) in soil and soil solution include mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and carbohydrates. Due to their high bioavailability they play a crucial role in the cycles of C and nutrients in soils. The variety of soil processes that involve LMWOS requires identifying their composition to elucidate reactions and transformations. In most studies, LMWOS are extracted under artificial conditions, e.g. batch experiments, which may overestimate the actual concentrations. This study measures the composition of carbohydrates and amino acids in solution of a Haplic Luvisol leached in a column experiment. A combined system for simultaneous leaching and blowout of CO2 was used to estimate LMWOS decomposition. 14C-labeled glucose was added as a highly sensitive tracer to control the efficiency of the LMWOS extraction by leaching and to estimate LMWOS decomposition during leaching. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), optimized for soil extracts, was used to analyze LMWOS composition. For HPLC optimization, different preparations of leached solutions (filtration vs. centrifugation, and drying vs. no-drying) were compared. For sugar determination, drying had no influence on the solution concentrations. In contrast, amino acid concentrations significantly decreased by drying LMWOS eluted substances. Combining the HPLC identification of eluted substances with 14C tracer application revealed that about 5{\%} of the glucose could be leached unchanged within 786 min (13.1 h), whereas about 84{\%} remained in the soil, 9{\%} were decomposed to CO2, and 2{\%} were transformed to other LMWOS and recovered in the soil solution. The total amino acid concentration (TAC) in soil solution was about 8.2 $\mu$mol l-1, dominated by alanine (14.4{\%} of TAC), glycine (13.4{\%}), glutamic acid (9.9{\%}), serine (9.4{\%}), and leucine (9.3{\%}). The total carbohydrate concentration was about 2.4 $\mu$M, dominated by glucose (29.9{\%}), glucuronic acid (26.8{\%}), and galacturonic acid (17.3{\%}). Ratios of hexoses to pentoses, amino sugars glucosamine to galactosamine, and neutral sugars to uronic acids were determined. All three parameters pointed to the dominant influence of plants as the source of LMWOS in the leached soil solution. Within the small contribution of microorganisms, bacteria dominated over fungi. These used biomarker ratios as well as LMWOS concentrations differed widely from the ones obtained with conventional batch extraction. More research is necessary to evaluate the application of these biomarkers to soil solutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multivariate regression trees (MRT) are a new statistical technique that can be used to explore, describe, and predict relationships between multispecies data and environmental characteristics. MRT forms clusters of sites by repeated splitting of the data, with each split defined by a simple rule based on environmental values. The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dissimilarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the environmental data are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environmental data are available. MRT is compared with redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis using simulated data and a field data set.},

During the slow and incomplete mineralization of sucralose in lake water, which was not increased by the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus, the same compound was produced. That product was further metabolized by microorganisms in lake water and soil. Mineralization was also slow in sewage under aerobic conditions, but organic products were not detected. Little or no CO2 was formed from the disaccharide in flooded soil or anaerobic sewage. Bacteria in culture did not use sucralose as a carbon source but did convert it to the presumed unsaturated aldehyde, 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-D-fructose and possibly the uronic acid of sucralose. Sucralose carbon was not incorporated into cells of two sucralose-metabolizing bacteria or the microbial biomass of sewage or lake water. The chlorinated disaccharide was slowly metabolized by a galactose oxidase preparation. It is concluded that the chlorinated sugar is acted on microbiologically by cometabolism. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In soil, the way biotic parameters impact the relationship between bacterial diversity and function is still unknown. To understand these interactions better, we used RNA-based stable-isotope probing to study the diversity of active atrazine-degrading bacteria in relation to atrazine degradation and to explore the impact of earthworm-soil engineering with respect to this relationship. Bulk soil, burrow linings and earthworm casts were incubated with (13)C-atrazine. The pollutant degradation was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for 8 days, whereas active atrazine degraders were identified at 2 and 8 days by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA in the (13)C-RNA fractions from the three soil microsites. An original diversity of atrazine degraders was found. Earthworm soil engineering greatly modified the taxonomic composition of atrazine degraders with dominance of $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-proteobacteria in burrow linings and of Actinobacteria in casts. Earthworm soil bioturbation increased the $\gamma$-diversity of atrazine degraders over the soil microsites generated. Atrazine degradation was enhanced in burrow linings in which primary atrazine degraders, closely related to Pelomonas aquatica, were detected only 2 days after atrazine addition. Atrazine degradation efficiency was not linearly related to the species richness of degraders but likely relied on keystone species. By enhancing soil heterogeneity, earthworms sustained high phylogenetic bacterial diversity and exerted a biotic control on the bacterial diversity-function relationships. Our findings call for future investigations to assess the ecological significance of biotic controls on the relationships between diversity and function on ecosystem properties and services (for example, soil detoxification) at larger scales.},

abstract = {Plant species, plant community diversity and microbial interactions can significantly impact soil microbial communities, yet there are few data on the interactive effects of plant species and plant community diversity on soil bacterial communities. We hypothesized that plant species and plant community diversity affect soil bacterial communities by setting the context in which bacterial interactions occur. Specifically, we examined soil bacterial community composition and diversity in relation to plant "host" species, plant community richness, bacterial antagonists, and soil edaphic characteristics. Soil bacterial communities associated with four different prairie plant species (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Lespedeza capitata, and Lupinus perennis) grown in plant communities of increasing species richness (1, 4, 8, and 16 species) were sequenced. Additionally, soils were evaluated for populations of antagonistic bacteria and edaphic characteristics. Plant species effects on soil bacterial community composition were small and depended on plant community richness. In contrast, increasing plant community richness significantly altered soil bacterial community composition and was negatively correlated with bacterial diversity. Concentrations of soil carbon, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were similarly negatively correlated with bacterial diversity, whereas the proportion of antagonistic bacteria was positively correlated with soil bacterial diversity. Results suggest that plant species influences on soil bacterial communities depend on plant community diversity and are mediated through the effects of plant-derived resources on antagonistic soil microbes.},

abstract = {Soil from Eutrochrept A horizons under long‐term spruce forest (Sf), mixed deciduous forest (Df), permanent grassland (Gp) and arable rotation (Ar) was fractionated according to particle size and analysed for contents of C, N, lignin‐derived phenols and carbohydrates. Whole soil from Sf, Df, Gp and Ar contained 84, 59, 73 and 25 g C kg−1 soil, respectively. For all sites, the C content declined and C/N ratio increased in the order: clay ({\textless}2 $\mu$m), silt (2–20 $\mu$m), sand (20–2000 $\mu$m). Clay and silt were significantly lower in C in Ar than in Sf, Df and Gp, C associated with sand being substantially lower under arable rotation. The yield of lignin‐derived phenols decreased and carboxyl functionality and methoxyl demethylation of lignin derivatives increased with decreasing particle size, indicating a progressive lignin alteration. Whole soil from Sf and Gp was substantially higher in vanillyl (V), syringyl (S) and cinnamyl (C) units (VSC) than soil from Df and Ar. Compared to whole soil, clay was depleted and sand enriched in VSC. Only sand appeared to be affected significantly by land use. Sand from Ar and Df was more enriched in VSC than sand from Gp and Sf. Whole soil carbohydrates decreased in the order: Gp{\textgreater}Ar{\textgreater}Df{\textgreater}Sf. Sand‐ and clay‐sized separates were enriched in carbohydrates compared to silt. Carbohydrates in sand were mainly of plant origin whereas microbially‐derived sugars accounted for a larger proportion in the clay. Compared to Sf, Df and Gp, clay from Ar was enriched and sand depleted in microbial sugars. Lignin and carbohydrate distribution patterns indicate that organic matter was in a more advanced stage of decomposition in the sand separates from forest than from agricultural A horizons. The forest soils also show a higher degree of oxidative changes in lignin associated with clay. In contrast, differences between silt from the four A horizons were small.

abstract = {California grasslands experience major seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall which may affect the microbial processing of nitrogen (N), a growth-limiting soil resource. While N cycling dynamics during the growing season (fall, winter, and spring) are well-studied in California grasslands, details about summer N cycling are scarce, presumably because researchers assume that nothing biologically important happens in soils during the hot, dry summer months when grasses are dead or dormant. However, studying soil N dynamics over the summer is crucial to understanding soil N availability at the beginning of the subsequent growing season. To characterize the differences between summertime and growing season N availability and microbial processing of N, we compared N pool sizes, rates of N mineralization, potential nitrification, potential denitrification, and microbial biomass during the dry non-growing season (late spring and summer) with those of the moist growing season (fall, winter, and early spring) in a California grassland. Many of the patterns we observed differed from our expectations; net mineralization, both nitrification and denitrification potentials, and microbial biomass all increased during summer. Our findings raise questions about the controls on N cycling in Mediterranean-type grassland ecosystems where plant productivity is controlled by rainfall, and suggest a greater level of complexity in the mechanisms behind N cycling dynamics in California grasslands than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In soil, the way biotic parameters impact the relationship between bacterial diversity and function is still unknown. To understand these interactions better, we used RNA-based stable-isotope probing to study the diversity of active atrazine-degrading bacteria in relation to atrazine degradation and to explore the impact of earthworm-soil engineering with respect to this relationship. Bulk soil, burrow linings and earthworm casts were incubated with (13)C-atrazine. The pollutant degradation was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for 8 days, whereas active atrazine degraders were identified at 2 and 8 days by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA in the (13)C-RNA fractions from the three soil microsites. An original diversity of atrazine degraders was found. Earthworm soil engineering greatly modified the taxonomic composition of atrazine degraders with dominance of $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-proteobacteria in burrow linings and of Actinobacteria in casts. Earthworm soil bioturbation increased the $\gamma$-diversity of atrazine degraders over the soil microsites generated. Atrazine degradation was enhanced in burrow linings in which primary atrazine degraders, closely related to Pelomonas aquatica, were detected only 2 days after atrazine addition. Atrazine degradation efficiency was not linearly related to the species richness of degraders but likely relied on keystone species. By enhancing soil heterogeneity, earthworms sustained high phylogenetic bacterial diversity and exerted a biotic control on the bacterial diversity-function relationships. Our findings call for future investigations to assess the ecological significance of biotic controls on the relationships between diversity and function on ecosystem properties and services (for example, soil detoxification) at larger scales.},

Heterogeneous data sets can be collectively mined by data fusion. Fusion can focus on a specific target relation and exploit directly associated data together with contextual data and data about system's constraints. In the paper we describe a data fusion approach with penalized matrix tri-factorization (DFMF) that simultaneously factorizes data matrices to reveal hidden associations. The approach can directly consider any data that can be expressed in a matrix, including those from feature-based representations, ontologies, associations and networks. We demonstrate the utility of DFMF for gene function prediction task with eleven different data sources and for prediction of pharmacologic actions by fusing six data sources. Our data fusion algorithm compares favorably to alternative data integration approaches and achieves higher accuracy than can be obtained from any single data source alone.},

abstract = {The relationship of soil organic matter (OM) concentration to microbial biomass concentration and mineralizable OM is central to understanding the establishment and functioning of soil nutrient cycles. These parameters are presumably related to aboveground plant biomass and plant N concentration, but the mechanisms and controls of these interactions are not well understood. To further evaluate these relationships, a field study was established in a series of soil materials whose organic C concentrations ranged from 1 to 21 g kg−1. Surface soil (0-15 cm) and vegetation samples were collected from plots of each treatment during the 1983 growing season. Microbial biomass was measured by chloroform fumigation and incubation; mineralizable C and N were measured in 20-d laboratory incubations; plant growth was measured by weighing material clipped from 0.18-m2 frames; and plant N concentration was measured by Kjeldahl digestion and colorimetric analysis. Microbial biomass increased linearly with soil OM concentration. Mineralizable N and plant production also increased with soil OM, but were greater with 7 than with 15 g kg−1 of organic C. Even though aboveground plant biomass was greater with either 7 or 15 than with 21 g kg−1 organic C, plant N concentrations were highest with 21 g kg−1. Soil OM concentrations were more closely related to microbial biomass than to mineralizable C and N, or to plant biomass and plant N concentrations. Nitrogen mineralization in the laboratory corresponded to plant N concentration in the field. Soil OM concentrations controlled microbial biomass C and N concentrations. However, additional factors also influenced the activity of the microbes and the resultant OM mineralization and plant N concentrations.},

Changes in the proportion of hemicellulosic glucose, arabinose, and xylose followed a somewhat zigzag course, though a consistent increase in the proportion of hemicellulosic glucose was observed after the flush of decomposition. The molar ratio of xylose to mannose decreased sharply at the flush of decomposition, then gradually afterwards, and reflected well the decomposition of the straw saccharides. The ratio of hemicellulosic glucose to cellulosic glucose became consistently larger with time after the flush of decomposition. Samples which contained less straw saccharides with the progression of the decomposition appeared to have larger molar ratios of hexoses to pentoses, deoxyhexoses to pentoses, and hemicellulosic saccharides to cellulosic saccharides. Even after 3 years of incubation, the monosaccharide composition of the straw, though more similar, was still quite different from that of soil, reflecting the persistence of the remaining straw saccharides. {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

These two soils were incubated alone and after adding unstabilised farmyard manure (FYM) or stabilised manure (compost), combined with the addition of mineral nutrients. Mineralisation of C (CO2 evolution) increased after FYM addition while it decreased after compost addition as compared to the control soils. When mineral nutrients were added to soils amended with FYM, C mineralisation synergistically increased only in soils with low nitrogen availability. In these soils, the addition of nutrients may promote the mobilization of soil C, while in soils with high N availability the synergistic mobilization of C on adding FYM may be reduced. In contrast, the depressed C mineralisation after the addition of compost was little affected by nutrient availability. We suggest that recalcitrant compounds in compost may be stabilised in soil particles and humic substances with little effects of nutrient availability. In contrast, the incorporation of FYM was mainly driven by microbial transformations and affected by nutrient availability. Finally, we conclude that the application of stabilised organic matter may be a good practice for the built up of humus in a wide range of arable lands with particular significance for land reclamation in organic matter depleted soils.

abstract = {Biochar is increasingly being recognized by scientists and policy makers for its potential role in carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, waste mitigation, and as a soil amendment. The published reviews on biochar application to soil have so far focused mainly on the agronomic benefits, and have paid little attention to the potential unintended effects. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a balanced perspective on the agronomic and environmental impacts of biochar amendment to soil. The chapter highlights the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar, which can impact on the sorption, hence efficacy and biodegradation, of pesticides. As a consequence, weed control in biochar-amended soils may prove more difficult as preemergent herbicides may be less effective. Since biochars are often prepared from a variety of feedstocks (including waste materials), the potential introduction of contaminants needs to be considered before land application. Metal contaminants, in particular, have been shown to impact on plant growth, and soil microbial and faunal communities. Biochar has also been shown to influence a range of soil chemical properties, and rapid changes to nutrient availability, pH, and electrical conductivity need to be carefully considered to avoid unintended consequences for productivity. This chapter highlights some key areas of research which need to be completed to ensure a safe and sustainable use of biochar. In particular, understanding characteristics of biochars to avoid ecotoxicological impacts, understanding the effects of biochar on nutrient and contaminant behavior and transport, the effects of aging and the influence of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions on key properties are some of the areas that require attention. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Extracellular enzymes allow microbes to acquire carbon and nutrients from complex molecules and catalyse the rate-limiting step in nutrient mineralization. Because the factors regulating enzyme production are poorly understood, I used a simulation model to examine how competition, nutrient availability and spatial structure affect microbial growth and enzyme synthesis. In simulations where enzyme-producing microbes competed with cheaters (who do not synthesize enzymes but take-up product), higher enzyme costs favoured cheaters, while lower rates of enzyme diffusion favoured producers. Cheaters and producers coexisted in highly organized spatial patterns at intermediate enzyme costs and diffusion rates. Simulations with varying nutrient inputs showed that nitrogen supply can limit carbon mineralization, microbial growth and enzyme production because of the nitrogen-demanding stoichiometry of enzymes (C:N = c. 3.5:1). These results suggest that competition from cheaters, slow diffusion and nitrogen limitation may constrain microbial foraging and the enzymatic decomposition of complex compounds in natural environments. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Current regulations are intended to protect the health of the general population by controlling pesticide use. This book explores whether the present regulatory approaches adequately protect infants and children, who may differ from adults in susceptibility and in dietary exposures to pesticide residues. The committee focuses on four major areas: Susceptibility: Are children more susceptible or less susceptible than adults to the effects of dietary exposure to pesticides? Exposure: What foods do infants and children eat, and which pesticides and how much of them are present in those foods? Is the current information on consumption and residues adequate to estimate exposure? Toxicity: Are toxicity tests in laboratory animals adequate to predict toxicity in human infants and children? Do the extent and type of toxicity of some chemicals vary by species and by age? Assessing risk: How is dietary exposure to pesticide residues associated with response? How can laboratory data on lifetime exposures of animals be used to derive meaningful estimates of risk to children? Does risk accumulate more rapidly during the early years of life? This book will be of interest to policymakers, administrators of research in the public and private sectors, toxicologists, pediatricians and other health professionals, and the pesticide industry.},

abstract = {Pirellula-like planctomycetes are ubiquitous aquatic bacteria, which are often detected in anoxic or micro-oxic habitats. By contrast, the taxonomically described representatives of these bacteria, with very few exceptions, are strict aerobes. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the facultatively anaerobic planctomycete, strain PX69T, which was isolated from a boreal lake. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence is affiliated with the Pirellula-related Pir4 clade, which is dominated by environmental sequences retrieved from a variety of low-oxygen habitats. Strain PX69T was represented by ellipsoidal cells that multiplied by budding and grew on sugars, some polysaccharides and glycerol. Anaerobic growth occurred by means of fermentation. Strain PX69T grew at pH 5.5–7.5 and at temperatures between 10 and 30 °C. The major fatty acids were C18:1$\omega$9c, C16:0 and C16:1$\omega$7c; the major intact polar lipid was dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine. The complete genome of strain PX69T was 6.92 Mb in size; DNA G + C content was 61.7 mol{\%}. Among characterized planctomycetes, the highest 16S rRNA gene similarity (90.4{\%}) was observed with ‘Bythopirellula goksoyri' Pr1d, a planctomycete from deep-sea sediments. We propose to classify PX69T as a novel genus and species, Lacipirellula parvula gen. nov., sp. nov.; the type strain is strain PX69T (=KCTC 72398T = CECT 9826T = VKM B-3335T). This genus is placed in a novel family, Lacipirellulaceae fam. nov., which belongs to the order Pirellulales ord. nov. Based on the results of comparative genome analysis, we also suggest establishment of the orders Gemmatales ord. nov. and Isosphaerales ord. nov. as well as an emendation of the order Planctomycetales.},

Statistical analyses of compositional data, however, are challenging due to several constraints (e.g., constant sum constraint). We use an ontogenetic series of defensive gland secretions from larvae, three nymphal stages and adults of the oribatid model species Archegozetes longisetosus as a typical chemo-ecological data set to prepare a practical guide for compositional data analyses in chemical ecology. We compare various common and less common statistical and ordination methods to depict small quantitative and/or qualitative differences in compositional datasets: principal component analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), multivariate statistical tests (Anderson's permutational multivariate analyses of variance = PERMANOVA; permutational analyses of multivariate dispersions = PERMDIPS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the data mining algorithm Random Forests, bipartite network analysis and dynamic range boxes (dynRB). We summarize which methods are suitable for different research questions and how data needs to be structured and pre-processed. Network analyses and dynamic range boxes are promising tools for analyzing compositional data beyond the “classical” methods and provide additional information.},

However, when Cmicr was calculated based on organic carbon (mg Cmicr g−1 Corg), close relationships with climatic variables were found. Especially, integrative climatic variables which reflected not only the temperature regime but also the moisture conditions, were found to be good predictors of the Cmicr-to-Corg ratio. The best predictor was the precipitation-evaporation quotient which accounted for 68{\%} of the variance. With a stepwise, multiple-linear regression procedure, the clay content and pH of the soils were found to account for another 2 and 3{\%} of the variance, respectively. Parts of the remaining variance could be accounted for by differences in fertilization, crops, tillage practices or residue returns. The Cmicr-to-Corg ratio of monocultures was significantly lower than that of crop rotations, and so was that of mineral fertilized compared to organically manured plots.  The organic matter content of the soils studied were at or near the equilibrium level. An equilibrium function for the Cmicr-to-Corg ratio was calculated: y = 18.18+ 108.3-e−6.728x, where x = precipitation/ evaporation. Deviation from this equilibrium line would indicate that a certain soil is losing or accumulating organic matter.},

abstract = {Changes in the monosaccharide composition during the decomposition of rice and barley straws under field conditions were examined. The proportion of mannose, galactose, fucose, rhamnose, and ribose increased consistently with time, whereas the proportion of cellulosic glucose became smaller consistently. Changes in the proportion of hemicellulosic glucose, arabinose, and xylose followed a somewhat zigzag course, though a consistent increase in the proportion of hemicellulosic glucose was observed after the flush of decomposition. The molar ratio of xylose to mannose decreased sharply at the flush of decomposition, then gradually afterwards, and reflected well the decomposition of the straw saccharides. The ratio of hemicellulosic glucose to cellulosic glucose became consistently larger with time after the flush of decomposition. Samples which contained less straw saccharides with the progression of the decomposition appeared to have larger molar ratios of hexoses to pentoses, deoxyhexoses to pentoses, and hemicellulosic saccharides to cellulosic saccharides. Even after 3 years of incubation, the monosaccharide composition of the straw, though more similar, was still quite different from that of soil, reflecting the persistence of the remaining straw saccharides. {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {A physiological method to assess the catabolic diversity of soil microbial communities was developed and applied. The method utilises differences between the substrate induced respiration (SIR) responses of microbial communities to simple organic compounds to quantify catabolic diversity. The investigation was conducted in three stages: (1) selection of suitable substrate concentrations; (2) selection of substrates and (3) application of the method to assess the catabolic diversity that had developed in soils over long and short periods. The concentrations of substrates giving optimal respiration response over 4 h were determined in four soils (three pasture and one forest) using 12 substrates selected from a range of amine acids, carboxylic acids, polymers and carbohydrates. Maximum SIR response could be obtained generally over a two-fold range of concentrations for most substrates. These results were used to select substrate, concentrations for testing the SIR responses of five soils (three pasture, one arable, one forest) to 83 simple sugars, carboxylic acids, amino acids, polymers, amines and amides. Principal components analysis (PCA) and calculation of the standard error of individual substrate responses across soils were used to identify the 36 substrates providing the greatest differences in SIR responses between the five so s SIR response profiles were determined using 36 substrates in soils under different management (grass pasture, reseeded grass pasture 2-y pasture ley, arable) and in glucose- amended soil over 3 wk. Analyses revealed that differences in SIR responses between substrates gradually declined with increasing so disturbance from pasture to arable soils. There were only small changes in catabolic diversity of the arable soils amended with glucose, despite a 1.35 fold increase in microbial biomass C during the first d. The physiological technique provided a reasonably rapid and simple method to assess the catabolic diversity of microbial communities without extracting or culturing organisms from soils.},

abstract = {The ability of microorganisms to use polyethylene as a carbon source has only been recently established. This result has significance both from an environmental point of view, due to the accumulation of millions of tons of waste plastics every year, but also regarding the conservation of integrity for infrastructures incorporating this plastic. A number of microorganisms with the ability to grow on polyethylene have been isolated. The effects of these microorganisms on the physiochemical properties of this polymer have been described; these include changes in crystallinity, molecular weight, topography of samples and the functional groups found on the surface. Although the bio-degradation and bio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several researchers, the enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these phenomena are still unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both enzymatic and abiotic factors (such UV light) can mediate the initial oxidation of polyethylene chains, and given the chemical similarity between polyethylene and olefins it has been suggested that the metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be used once the size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range for enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons). The long-range structure and morphology of polyethylene have shown important roles, with amorphous regions being more prone to microbial attack than crystalline ones. This review focuses on the recent hypotheses and experimental findings regarding the biodegradation of polyethylene. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent algorithmic advances in amplicon-based microbiome studies enable the inference of exact amplicon sequence fragments. These new methods enable the investigation of sub-operational taxonomic units (sOTU) by removing erroneous sequences. However, short (e.g., 150-nucleotide [nt]) DNA sequence fragments do not contain sufficient phylogenetic signal to reproduce a reasonable tree, introducing a barrier in the utilization of critical phylogenetically aware metrics such as Faith's PD or UniFrac. Although fragment insertion methods do exist, those methods have not been tested for sOTUs from high-throughput amplicon studies in insertions against a broad reference phylogeny. We benchmarked the SAT{\'{e}}-enabled phylogenetic placement (SEPP) technique explicitly against 16S V4 sequence fragments and showed that it outperforms the conceptually problematic but often-used practice of reconstructing de novo phylogenies. In addition, we provide a BSD-licensed QIIME2 plugin (https://github.com/biocore/q2-fragment-insertion) for SEPP and integration into the microbial study management platform QIITA. IMPORTANCE The move from OTU-based to sOTU-based analysis, while providing additional resolution, also introduces computational challenges. We demonstrate that one popular method of dealing with sOTUs (building a de novo tree from the short sequences) can provide incorrect results in human gut metagenomic studies and show that phylogenetic placement of the new sequences with SEPP resolves this problem while also yielding other benefits over existing methods.},

abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

abstract = {We studied the sorption-desorption behaviour of two herbicides (diuron and artrazine) in a soil rich in Fe and Al oxides (Ferrosol), either amended freshly with two different types of biochars or that contained biochars aged under field conditions. Standard batch sorption-desorption experiments were conducted on soil samples freshly amended with two biochars, (namely, poultry litter - PL and paper mill - PM sludge) as well on those collected from field 32months after biochar application. Soils that were freshly amended with biochars @ 10tha-1 showed a two (PM) to five (PL) fold increase in sorption of herbicides as compared with that in the unamended soil. For example, the fresh amendments with PL biochar at 10tha-1 led to a highly significant (P{\textless}0.001) increase in the Freundlich sorption coefficient (Kf) of atrazine; i.e. 20.71 (n=0.40) as compared with 4.02 (n=0.70) for the control soil. Sorption was reversible in the unamended soil but sorption-desorption hysteresis was prominent in the soil amended with fresh biochars. In contrast, the soil containing aged biochars (at 10tha-1) exhibited sorption-desorption properties that were statistically similar to that of the control soil, especially for atrazine. Ageing of biochars in the soil over a 32months period reduced the sorption capacity by 47{\%} (PM) to 68{\%} (PL) for diuron. These findings may have implications for herbicide efficacy in biochar amended soils. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Plant growth can be an important factor regulating seasonal variations of soil microbial biomass and activity. We investigated soil microbial biomass, microbial respiration, net N mineralization, and soil enzyme activity in turfgrass systems of three cool-season species (tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb., Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., and creeping bentgrass, Agrostis palustris L.) and three warm-season species (centipedegrass, Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro.) Hack, zoysiagrass, Zoysia japonica Steud, and bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.). Microbial biomass and respiration were higher in warm- than the cool-season turfgrass systems, but net N mineralization was generally lower in warm-season turfgrass systems. Soil microbial biomass C and N varied seasonally, being lower in September and higher in May and December, independent of turfgrass physiological types. Seasonal variations in microbial respiration, net N mineralization, and cellulase activity were also similar between warm- and cool-season turfgrass systems. The lower microbial biomass and activity in September were associated with lower soil available N, possibly caused by turfgrass competition for this resource. Microbial biomass and activity (i.e., microbial respiration and net N mineralization determined in a laboratory incubation experiment) increased in soil samples collected during late fall and winter when turfgrasses grew slowly and their competition for soil N was weak. These results suggest that N availability rather than climate is the primary determinant of seasonal dynamics of soil microbial biomass and activity in turfgrass systems, located in the humid and warm region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The susceptibility of dioxins to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-mediated dechlorination reactions was investigated using 1,2,3,4,6,7,9- heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), Aldrich humic acid (AHA), and polymaleic acid (PMA) as model compounds. The dechlorination yields were on the order of 4-20{\%} which, when normalized to phenolic acidity, was comparable to yields observed in the presence of the humic constituents catechol and resorcinol. Based on the ratio of dechlorination yields as a function of phenolic acidity and electron transfer capacity, differences in electron transfer efficiency to dioxins are likely combined effects of specific interactions with the functional groups and nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Hexa- and penta CDD homologues were dominant in all incubations, and diCDD constituted the final product of dechlorination. The rates of appearance of lesser chlorinated products (pMnM/d) were similar to those observed in sediment systems and followed thermodynamic considerations as they decreased with a decrease in level of chlorination. Generally, both absolute and phenolic acidity-normalized rate constants for AHA-mediated reactions were up to 2- fold higher than those effected by PMA. These results indicate that the electron shuttling capacity of sediment DOC may significantly affect the fate of dioxins, in part through dechlorination reactions.},

Plants can be used for pollutant stabilization; extraction, degradation, or volatilization. These different phytoremediation technologies are reviewed here, including their applicability for various organic and inorganic pollutants, and most suitable plant species. To further enhance the efficiency of phytoremediation, there is a need for better knowledge of the processes that affect pollutant availability, rhizosphere processes, pollutant uptake, translocation, chelation, degradation, and volatilization. For each of these processes I review what is known so far for inorganic and organic pollutants, the remaining gaps in our knowledge, and the practical implications for designing phytoremediation strategies. Transgenic approaches to enhance these processes are also reviewed and discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. The behavior of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as DDTs, endosulfans, HCHs, heptachlors, drins and chlordanes, has been evaluated in the Quequ{\'{e}}n Grande River agricultural watershed including different matrices. Soil profiles from fields dedicated to soybean cultures and the associated terrestrial biota (earthworms, coleopteran larvae, collembolan and mites), stream water, suspended particle matter and surface sediment were sampled during the pre-application pesticide period. Pesticide analyses were carried out using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. Soils samples showed a differential pesticide pattern throughout the profile. Control soils, settled 200 m from agricultural plots showed similar pesticide levels but with higher variety of compounds, denoting the historical use of OCPs in the zone. However, in agricultural plots DDTs and endosulfans constituted 90 {\%} of the pesticides found with a further enrichment of endosulfan sulfate at depth. The relatively high p,p′-DDT levels in surface agricultural soil would be a consequence of pesticide impurities in technical acaricide Dicofol, which is widely used in the region; and it represents a new threat of fresh p,p′-DDT input into environment despite its use being forbidden. Terrestrial biota, mainly mesofauna showed high capacity to OCP accumulation, the aforementioned organisms being a good option in the monitoring of trace pesticides. Furthermore, the high OCP levels found constitute a hazard to food web since these organisms are one of the first steps in the food chain and the biomagnification is a common process with these compounds. As a result of runoff and volatilization the occurrence of OCPs in the aquatic environment was observed, draining a load of around 7.3 kg of pesticides into the river annually. As a whole, these results suggest the importance of using terrestrial biota for studying recalcitrant pesticides and a continuous monitoring is strongly advised as a first step in minimizing environmental risks.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) deficiency in some plant species triggers the release of organic anions such as citrate and malate from roots. These anions are widely suggested to enhance the availability of phosphate for plant uptake by mobilizing sparingly-soluble forms in the soil. Carazinho is an old wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar from Brazil, which secretes citrate constitutively from its root apices, and here we show that it also produces relatively more biomass on soils with low P availability than two recent Australian cultivars that lack citrate efflux. To test whether citrate efflux explains this phenotype, we generated two sets of near-isogenic lines that differ in citrate efflux and compared their biomass production in different soil types and with different P treatments in glasshouse experiments and field trials. Citrate efflux improved relative biomass production in two of six glasshouse trials but only at the lowest P treatments where growth was most severely limited by P availability. Furthermore, citrate efflux provided no consistent advantage for biomass production or yield in multiple field trials. Theoretical modeling indicates that the effectiveness of citrate efflux in mobilizing soil P is greater as the volume of soil into which it diffuses increases. As efflux from these wheat plants is restricted to the root apices, the potential for citrate to mobilize sufficient P to increase shoot biomass may be limited. We conclude that Carazinho has other attributes that contribute to its comparatively good performance in low-P soils. {\textcopyright} 2014 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.},

This study evaluated the ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to rapidly predict soil properties affected by land use change from agriculture (mainly pasture) to Eucalyptus globulus plantations in south-western Australia. We measured total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (Total N), TOC/Total N (C/N ratio), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and total phosphorus (Total P). The PLSR calibration models were developed using mid-infrared (MIR) spectra (4000 to 450 cm -1 ) and square root transformed measured soil data (n = 180) from 23 paired pasture and E. globulus plantation sites representing the soils and climate of E. globulus plantation estates in south-western Australia. The calibration models for TOC, Total N, C/N ratio and Total P showed excellent correlations between measured and predicted data with coefficient of determination (R 2 ) exceeding 0.91 and minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) of calibration [TOC (R 2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.36), Total N (R 2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.10), C/N ratio (R 2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.14) and Total P (R 2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.06)]. The calibration models had reasonable predictions for MBC (R 2 = 0.66, RMSE = 0.07) and MBN (R 2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.06). The calibrated models were validated using soils from 8 independent paired pasture and E. globulus sites (n = 64). The validated predictions were excellent for TOC (R 2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.40) and Total N (R 2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.12), but less so for C/N ratio (R 2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.35), MBC (R 2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.08) and Total P (R 2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.12).

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

However, the physicochemical properties and the functional moieties of humins from different natural sources have been poorly characterized. In this study, humins extracted from seven types of soil and from a river sediment were examined on the effect on microbial reductive dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and characterized polyphasically. All humins facilitated microbial reductive dechlorination of PCP as electron mediators using formate as carbon source, with different dechlorination rates ranging from 0.99 to 7.63 ($\mu$molCl{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}d{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. The highest rates were observed in humins with high carbon contents, extracted from Andisols containing allophone as major clay. Yields of the humins and the elemental compositions varied among sources. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that all the humins exhibited similar spectra with different absorbance intensity; these data are indicative of their similar structures and identical classes of functional groups. The electron spin resonance spectra of humins prepared at different pH showed typical changes for the semiquinone-type radicals, suggestive of quinone moieties for the redox activity of the humins. Cyclic voltammetry analysis confirmed the presence of redox-active moieties in all the humins, with the estimated redox potentials in the range of -0.30 to -0.13V (versus a standard hydrogen electrode), falling into the range of standard redox potential between the oxidation of formate as electron donor and the initial dechlorination of PCP as electron acceptor.},

abstract = {Successful remediation of soils co-contaminated with organics and metals may require a combination of technologies. This research addresses the organic component within co-contaminated sites. It is well known that metal contaminants in soil can partially or completely inhibit normal helerotrophic microbial activity and hence prevent in situ biodegradation of organics. Previous work has shown that a rhamnolipid biosurfactant can complex metals such as lead and cadmium. It has also been demonstrated, in pure culture, that rhamnolipid can mitigate metal inhibition during the degradation of naphthalene. The goal of this study was to investigate whether rhamnolipid could reduce the toxicity of a model metal, cadmium, to indigenous soil populations in two different soils, Brazito and Gila, during the mineralization of phenanthrene. Results show that cadmium inhibited phenanthrene mineralization in both soils at bioavailable cadmium concentrations as low as 27 $\mu$M. This inhibition was reduced by the addition of rhamnolipid. Since rhamnolipid is degraded by soil populations, a rhamnolipid pulsing strategy was used to maintain a constant level of rhamnolipid in the system. Using this strategy, phenanthrene mineralization levels comparable to the control (0 mM Cd/0 mM rhamnolipid) were achieved in the presence of toxic cadmium concentrations. This research demonstrates that pulsed application of rhamnolipid may allow bioremedialion of organic contaminants in sites that are co-contaminated with organics and metals.},

In this work, we have developed and implemented a set of synthetic 16S rRNA genes to serve as uni-versal spike-in standards for 16S-seq experiments. The spike-ins represent full-length 16S rRNA genes containing artificial variable regions with negligible identity to known nucleotide sequences, permitting unambiguous identification of spike-in sequences in 16S-seq read data from any microbiome sample. Using defined mock communities and environmen-tal microbiota, we characterized the performance of the spike-in standards and demonstrated their util-ity for evaluating data quality on a per-sample ba-sis. Further, we showed that staggered spike-in mix-tures added at the point of DNA extraction enable concurrent estimation of absolute microbial abun-dances suitable for comparative analysis. Results also underscored that template-specific Illumina se-quencing artifacts may lead to biases in the per-ceived abundance of certain taxa. Taken together, the spike-in standards represent a novel bioana-lytical tool that can substantially improve 16S-seq-based microbiome studies by enabling comprehen-sive quality control along with absolute quantifica-tion.},

abstract = {Indicator species are species that are used as ecological indicators of community or habitat types, environmental conditions, or environmental changes. In order to determine indicator species, the characteristic to be predicted is represented in the form of a classification of the sites, which is compared to the patterns of distribution of the species found at the sites. Indicator species analysis should take into account the fact that species have different niche breadths: if a species os related to the conditions prevailing in two or more groups of sites, an indicator species analysis undertaken on individual groups of sites may fail to reveal this association. In this paper, we suggest improving indicator species analysis by considering all possible combinations of groups of sites and selecting the combination for which the species can be best used as indicator. When using a correlation index, such as the point-biserial correlation, the method yields the combination where the difference between the observed and expected abundance/frequency of the species is largest.

abstract = {A conceptual model emphasizing direct host-microbe interactions has dominated work on host-associated microbiomes. To understand plant-microbiome associations, however, broader influences on microbiome composition and functioning must be incorporated, such as those arising from plant-plant and microbe-microbe interactions. We sampled soil microbiomes associated with target plant species (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Lespedeza capitata, Lupinus perennis) grown in communities varying in plant richness (1-, 4-, 8- or 16-species). We assessed Streptomyces antagonistic activity and analysed bacterial and Streptomyces populations via 454 pyrosequencing. Host plant species and plant richness treatments altered networks of coassociation among bacterial taxa, suggesting the potential for host plant effects on the soil microbiome to include changes in microbial interaction dynamics and, consequently, co-evolution. Taxa that were coassociated in the rhizosphere of a given host plant species often showed consistent correlations between operational taxonomic unit (OTU) relative abundance and Streptomyces antagonistic activity, in the rhizosphere of that host. However, in the rhizosphere of a different host plant species, the same OTUs showed no consistency, or a different pattern of responsiveness to such biotic habitat characteristics. The diversity and richness of bacterial and Streptomyces communities exhibited distinct relationships with biotic and abiotic soil characteristics. The rhizosphere soil microbiome is influenced by a complex and nested array of factors at varying spatial scales, including plant community, plant host, soil edaphics and microbial taxon and community characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

SUMMARY The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

@article{Reineke2001a,
abstract = {Microorganisms represent essential components of the global carbon cycle. In addition, it appears that most xenobiotic industrial chemicals can be degraded by microorganisms, either by a combination of cometabolic steps, often yielding partial degradation, or by serving as growth substrate which is accompanied by mineralization of at least part of the molecule. Using a number of examples, including aromatic, chloroaromatic, aliphatic, and chloroaliphatic compounds, I have presented some principles on the degradation. The great influence of some environmental conditions on the degradation, such as the presence or absence of oxygen, the availability of other electron acceptors such as nitrate or sulfate, has been discussed with special emphasis on the type of reactions and the rates of degradation that occur. While aerobic microorganisms use oxidative reactions, the degradation by anaerobic bacteria takes place by reductive types of reactions. The oxidative sequences of aromatic and chloroaromatic compounds in aerobic bacteria yield central intermediates with a diphenolic structure. These compounds are then cleaved by enzymes that use molecular oxygen. In contrast, the anaerobes degrade aromatic compounds by reductive conversions and the central intermediates ready for hydrolytic ring cleavage bear a 1,3-dioxo structure. Aerobic bacteria and fungi, especially ligninolytic ones, were shown to use mechanistically different catabolic pathways and enzymes. The ligninolytic fungi convert oxygen to hydrogen peroxide which is then used for the formation of an aryl cation radical undergoing spontaneous rearrangements and degradation. The broad variety of mechanisms which brings about dechlorination is another important part of this work.Although the diversity of the compounds discussed is very large, the strategy of the organisms used in the degradation includes various analogous reactions. Another important aspect of discussion is the different degree of degradation.While most research is done on organisms that are able to use the respective compound as the growth substrate, i.e., carbon dioxide and biomass result, the cometabolic potential of microorganisms should not be neglected. Cometabolism takes place very much in nature and brings about some modification of a target compound. In general, anoxic microbial degradation seems to be of greater relevance in nature than earlier expected. It is remarkable that some chlorinated compounds such as chlorobenzoates, chlorophenols, or tetrachloroethene may function as a physiologically functional electron acceptor in a type of anaerobic respiration,which leads to non-chlorinated or lower chlorinated products. Since various compounds will not be degraded totally by one type of organism the complementary potential of anaerobic and aerobic populations in combination is thought to be a method to bring about complete mineralization. Finally, the possibility of enhancing the degradative potential of aerobic organisms in the laboratory, i.e., artificial evolution of enzymes and pathways, by different genetic approaches, is discussed.},

Background and aims: Plants and contaminant-degrading microbes are a suitable combination for the remediation of pesticides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Streptomyces strains cultured with maize plants in relation to lindane removal. Methods: Four Streptomyces strains were cultured and added as both single and mixed cultures, along with maize plants,  to artificially polluted hydroponic systems and soils. The effectiveness of the resulting soil bioremediation was then evaluated through phytotoxicity testing using lettuce seedlings. Results: In the hydroponic and soil experiments, similar levels of lindane removal were recorded in the inoculated and non-inoculated systems where maize plants were introduced. However, the vigor index (VI) of the maize plants was highest when grown in inoculated and artificially polluted soil. In the phytotoxicity assay, the VI of the lettuce seedlings increased with increasing bioremediation time for the soils, thus indicating the effectiveness of the process. Conclusions: Similar levels of lindane removal were recorded in both inoculated and non-inoculated planted systems, indicating that pesticide removal was not significantly affected by the bacterial inoculant. However, inoculation an actinobacteria consortium led to an increase in the VI of the maize and protected the plants against the existing toxicity. Furthermore, maize plants may attenuate the transient toxic effects of microbial lindane degradation.},

abstract = {Indicator species are species that are used as ecological indicators of community or habitat types, environmental conditions, or environmental changes. In order to determine indicator species, the characteristic to be predicted is represented in the form of a classification of the sites, which is compared to the patterns of distribution of the species found at the sites. Indicator species analysis should take into account the fact that species have different niche breadths: if a species os related to the conditions prevailing in two or more groups of sites, an indicator species analysis undertaken on individual groups of sites may fail to reveal this association. In this paper, we suggest improving indicator species analysis by considering all possible combinations of groups of sites and selecting the combination for which the species can be best used as indicator. When using a correlation index, such as the point-biserial correlation, the method yields the combination where the difference between the observed and expected abundance/frequency of the species is largest. When an indicator value index (IndVal) is used, the method provides the set of site-groups that best matches the observed distribution pattern of the species. We illustrate the advantages of the method in three different examples. Consideration of combinations of groups of sites provides an extra flexibility to qualitatively model the habitat preferences of the species of interest. The method also allows users to cross multiple classifications of the same sites, increasing the amount of information resulting from the analysis. When applied to community types, it allows one to distinguish those species that characterize individual types from those that characterize the relationships between them.

abstract = {The problem of pattern and scale is a central challenge in ecology (sensu Levin, 1992). The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of nitrogen fixing trees into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data. The phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet the logic of defining phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest is still applicable. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for traits and community-ecological data from any exponential-family distribution. Generalizing phylofactorization yields many tools for analyzing community ecological data. In the context of generalized phylofactorization, we identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. We introduce a phylogenetic analysis of variance which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut. We employ generalized additive modeling of microbes in central park soils to confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. We demonstrate how to extend phylofactorization to generalized linear and additive modeling of any dataset of exponential family random variables. We finish with a discussion of how phylofactorization produces a novel species concept, a hybrid of a phylogenetic and ecological species concepts in which the phylogenetic scales and units of interest are defined objectively by defining the ecological pattern and partitioning the phylogeny into clades based on different contributions to the pattern. All of these tools can be implemented with a new R package available online.},

While our tools primarily target phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic placements, they also offer a plethora of functions for handling genetic sequences, taxonomies, and other relevant data types. The tools aim at improved usability at the production stage (conducting data analyses) as well as the development stage (rapid prototyping): The modular interface of genesis simplifies numerous standard high-level tasks and analyses, while allowing for low-level customization at the same time. Our implementation relies on modern, multi-threaded C++11, and is substantially more computationally efficient than analogous tools.

abstract = {Correlation coefficients are most popular in statistical practice for measuring pairwise variable associations. Compositional data, carrying only relative information, require a different treatment in correlation analysis. For identifying the association between two compositional parts in terms of their dominance with respect to the other parts in the composition, symmetric balances are constructed, which capture all relative information in the form of aggregated logratios of both compositional parts of interest. The resulting coordinates have the form of logratios of individual parts to a (weighted) “average representative” of the other parts, and thus, they clearly indicate how the respective parts dominate in the composition on average. The balances form orthonormal coordinates, and thus, the standard correlation measures relying on the Euclidean geometry can be used to measure the association. Simulation studies provide deeper insight into the proposed approach, and allow for comparisons with alternative measures. An application from geochemistry (Kola moss) indicates that correlations based on symmetric balances serve as a sensitive tool to reveal underlying geochemical processes.},

@article{Riley2019,
abstract = {In the medical literature, hundreds of prediction models are being developed to predict health outcomes in individuals. For continuous outcomes, typically a linear regression model is developed to predict an individual's outcome value conditional on values of multiple predictors (covariates). To improve model development and reduce the potential for overfitting, a suitable sample size is required in terms of the number of subjects (n) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) for potential inclusion. We propose that the minimum value of n should meet the following four key criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9; (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the apparent and adjusted R 2 ; (iii) precise estimation (a margin of error ≤ 10{\%} of the true value) of the model's residual standard deviation; and similarly, (iv) precise estimation of the mean predicted outcome value (model intercept). The criteria require prespecification of the user's chosen p and the model's anticipated R 2 as informed by previous studies. The value of n that meets all four criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. In an applied example, a new model to predict lung function in African-American women using 25 predictor parameters requires at least 918 subjects to meet all criteria, corresponding to at least 36.7 subjects per predictor parameter. Even larger sample sizes may be needed to additionally ensure precise estimates of key predictor effects, especially when important categorical predictors have low prevalence in certain categories.},

abstract = {Plant species, plant community diversity and microbial interactions can significantly impact soil microbial communities, yet there are few data on the interactive effects of plant species and plant community diversity on soil bacterial communities. We hypothesized that plant species and plant community diversity affect soil bacterial communities by setting the context in which bacterial interactions occur. Specifically, we examined soil bacterial community composition and diversity in relation to plant "host" species, plant community richness, bacterial antagonists, and soil edaphic characteristics. Soil bacterial communities associated with four different prairie plant species (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Lespedeza capitata, and Lupinus perennis) grown in plant communities of increasing species richness (1, 4, 8, and 16 species) were sequenced. Additionally, soils were evaluated for populations of antagonistic bacteria and edaphic characteristics. Plant species effects on soil bacterial community composition were small and depended on plant community richness. In contrast, increasing plant community richness significantly altered soil bacterial community composition and was negatively correlated with bacterial diversity. Concentrations of soil carbon, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were similarly negatively correlated with bacterial diversity, whereas the proportion of antagonistic bacteria was positively correlated with soil bacterial diversity. Results suggest that plant species influences on soil bacterial communities depend on plant community diversity and are mediated through the effects of plant-derived resources on antagonistic soil microbes.},

abstract = {Aim: To estimate the concentrations, stoichiometry and storage of soil microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at biome and global scales. Location: Global. Method: We collected 3422 data points to summarize the concentrations and stoichiometry of C, N and P in soils, soil microbial biomass at global and biome levels, and to estimate the global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N. Results: The results show that concentrations of C, N and P in soils and soil microbial biomass vary substantially across biomes; the fractions of soil elements C, N and P in soil microbial biomass are 1.2, 2.6 and 8.0{\%}, respectively. The best estimates of C:N:P stoichiometry for soil elements and soil microbial biomass are 287:17:1 and 42:6:1, respectively, at global scale, and they vary in a wide range among biomes. The vertical distribution of soil microbial biomass follows the distribution of roots up to 1m depth. Main conclusions: The global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N were estimated to be 16.7 Pg C and 2.6 Pg N in the 0-30cm soil profiles, and 23.2 Pg C and 3.7 Pg N in the 0-100cm soil profiles. We did not estimate P in soil microbial biomass due to insufficient data and insignificant correlation between soil total P and climate variables used for spatial extrapolation. The spatial patterns of soil microbial biomass C and N were consistent with those of soil organic C and total N, i.e. high density in northern high latitude, and low density in low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Strain 853-15AT was enriched and isolated from uranium-contaminated aquifer sediment by its ability to grow under anaerobic conditions via the oxidation of lactate coupled to the reduction of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) to anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AHQDS). Lactate was oxidized incompletely to acetate and carbon dioxide according to the reaction CH3CHOHCOO- + 2AQDS+H2O → CH3 COO- + 2AHQDS+CO2. Additional electron donors utilized included formate, ethanol, butanol, butyrate, malate and pyruvate. Lactate also supported growth with Fe(III) citrate, Mn(IV) oxide, humic substances, elemental sulfur, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate, trichloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene serving as the electron acceptor. Growth was not observed with sulfate, sulfite, nitrate or fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. The temperature optimum for growth was 30 °C, but growth was also observed at 20 and 37 °C. The pH optimum was approximately 7.0. The 16S rDNA sequence of strain 853-15AT suggested that it was most closely related to Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans and closely related to Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans and Desulfitobacterium frappieri. The phylogenetic and physiological properties exhibited by strain 853-15AT (= ATCC BAA-636T) place it within the genus Desulfitobacterium as the type strain of a novel species, Desulfitobacterium metallireducens sp. nov.},

abstract = {Lipases, triacylglycerol hydrolases, are an important group of biotechnologically relevant enzymes and they find immense applications in food, dairy, detergent and pharmaceutical industries. Lipases are by and large produced from microbes and specifically bacterial lipases play a vital role in commercial ventures. Some important lipase-producing bacterial genera include Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia. Lipases are generally produced on lipidic carbon, such as oils, fatty acids, glycerol or tweens in the presence of an organic nitrogen source. Bacterial lipases are mostly extracellular and are produced by submerged fermentation. The enzyme is most commonly purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, in addition to some modern approaches such as reverse micellar and aqueous two-phase systems. Most lipases can act in a wide range of pH and temperature, though alkaline bacterial lipases are more common. Lipases are serine hydrolases and have high stability in organic solvents. Besides these, some lipases exhibit chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. The latest trend in lipase research is the development of novel and improved lipases through molecular approaches such as directed evolution and exploring natural communities by the metagenomic approach. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbon catabolic genes were investigated in soils and sediments in nine different locations around Syowa Station, Antarctica, using conventional PCR, real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing analysis. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD)-coding genes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Clone libraries of Gram-positive RHD genes were related to (i) nidA3 of Mycobacterium sp. py146, (ii) pdoA of Terrabacter sp. HH4, (iii) nidA of Diaphorobacter sp. KOTLB, and (iv) pdoA2 of Mycobacterium sp. CH-2, with 95–99 {\%} similarity. Clone libraries of Gram-negative RHD genes were related to the following: (i) naphthalene dioxygenase of Burkholderia glathei, (ii) phnAc of Burkholderia sartisoli, and (iii) RHD alpha subunit of uncultured bacterium, with 41–46 {\%} similarity. Interestingly, the diversity of the Gram-positive RHD genes found around this area was higher than those of the Gram-negative RHD genes. Real-time PCR showed different abundance of dioxygenase genes between locations. Moreover, the PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile demonstrated diverse bacterial populations, according to their location. Forty dominant fragments in the DGGE profiles were excised and sequenced. All of the sequences belonged to ten bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Cyanobacteria, Chlorobium, and Acidobacteria. In addition, the bacterial genus Sphingomonas, which has been suggested to be one of the major PAH degraders in the environment, was observed in some locations. The results demonstrated that indigenous bacteria have the potential ability to degrade PAHs and provided information to support the conclusion that bioremediation processes can occur in the Antarctic soils and sediments studied here.},

abstract = {During the last two decades, extensive research has explored the catalytic effects of different organic molecules with redox mediating properties on the anaerobic (bio)transformation of a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds. The accumulated evidence points at a major role of electron shuttles in the redox conversion of several distinct contaminants, both by chemical and biological mechanisms. Many microorganisms are capable of reducing redox mediators linked to the anaerobic oxidation of organic and inorganic substrates. Electron shuttles can also be chemically reduced by electron donors commonly found in anaerobic environments (e.g. sulfide and ferrous iron). Reduced electron shuttles can transfer electrons to several distinct electron-withdrawing compounds, such as azo dyes, polyhalogenated compounds, nitroaromatics and oxidized metalloids, among others. Moreover, reduced molecules with redox properties can support the microbial reduction of electron acceptors, such as nitrate, arsenate and perchlorate. The aim of this review paper is to summarize the results of reductive (bio)transformation processes catalyzed by electron shuttles and to indicate which aspects should be further investigated to enhance the applicability of redox mediators on the (bio)transformation of contaminants. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Soil microbial communities are intricately linked to ecosystem functioning because they play important roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Still, we know little about how soil microbial communities will be affected by disturbances expected with climate change. This is a significant gap in understanding, as the stability of microbial communities, defined as a community's ability to resist and recover from disturbances, likely has consequences for ecosystem function. Here, we propose a framework for predicting a community's response to climate change, based on specific functional traits present in the community, the relative dominance of r- and K-strategists, and the soil environment. We hypothesize that the relative abundance of r- and K-strategists will inform about a community's resistance and resilience to climate change associated disturbances. We also propose that other factors specific to soils, such as moisture content and the presence of plants, may enhance a community's resilience. For example, recent evidence suggests microbial grazers, resource availability, and plant roots each impact on microbial community stability. We explore these hypotheses by offering three vignettes of published data that we re-analyzed. Our results show that community measures of the relative abundance of r- and K-strategists, as well as environmental properties like resource availability and the abundance and diversity of higher trophic levels, can contribute to explaining the response of microbial community composition to climate change-related disturbances. However, further investigation and experimental validation is necessary to directly test these hypotheses across a wide range of soil ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2013 de Vries and Shade.},

SUMMARY The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a ubiquity of molecular sequence data. This data avalanche is particularly challenging in metagenetics, which focuses on taxonomic identification of sequences obtained from diverse microbial environments. To achieve this, phylogenetic placement methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context. Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or pplacer, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations face substantial scalability limitations. Here we present EPA-ng, a complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster, offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts from both, RAxML-EPA, and pplacer. EPA-ng can be executed on standard shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-ng we placed 1 billion metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree with 3,748 taxa in just under 7 hours, using 2,048 cores. Our performance assessment shows that EPA-ng outperforms RAxML-EPA and pplacer by up to a factor of 30 in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable parallel efficiency on shared memory systems. We further show that the distributed memory parallelization of EPA-ng scales well up to 3,520 cores. EPA-ng is available under the AGPLv3 license: https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng},

abstract = {Biotransformation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) by Alcaligenes eutrophus A5 was demonstrated by analysis of ethyl acetate-extracted products from resting cell cultures. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization of the neutral extracts revealed two hydroxy-DDT intermediates (m/z = 370) with retention times at 19.55 and 19.80 min that shared identical mass spectra. This result suggested that the hydroxylations occurred at the ortho and meta positions on the aromatic ring. UV-visible spectrum spectrophotometric analysis of a yellow metabolite in the culture supernatant showed a maximum A402 with, under acidic and basic conditions, spectrophotometric characteristics similar to those of the aromatic ring meta-cleavage products. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid was detected by thin-layer chromatography radiochemical scanning in samples from mineralization experiments by comparison of Rf values of [14C]DDT intermediates with that of an authentic standard. These results were further confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This study indicates that DDT appears to be oxidized by a dioxygenase in A. eutrophus A5 and that the products of this oxidation are subsequently subjected to ring fission to eventually yield 4-chlorobenzoic acid as a major stable intermediate.},

abstract = {Abstract Several fungi were isolated from an agricultural loam soil and tested for their capacity to degrade the insecticides DDT or dieldrin. It was found that Mucor alter nans van Tieghen in shake cultures partially degraded DDT within 2 to 4 days into 3 hexane-soluble and 2 water-soluble metabolites. None of these compounds had R 1 valutes that were identical to those observed with DDD (TDE), DDE (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene), DDA (bis-(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid), DBP (4,4´-dichlorobenzophenone), dicofol, and 1,1-bis (p-chloropbenyl) ethane. After application of C 14 -DDT, 42{\%} of the totally recovered radioactivity was represented by the 2 water-soluble metabolites. Some indication of dieldrin breakdown by the fungus was evident, but no metabolites could be isolated. Degradation of both DDT and dieldrin occurred only with live fungi mycelia, while the insecticides were passively absorbed to dead mycelial controls. After the addition of M. alternans spores to a DDT- or dieldrin-contaminated agricultural loam soil, the insecticide degrading capacity of the fungus was no longer evident. This result was rather disappointing since a need exists to be able to degrade persistent pesticides in nature with soil microorganisms. Since DDE was only found in nonautoclaved soils, its formation from DDT was a function of soil microorganisms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. The behavior of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as DDTs, endosulfans, HCHs, heptachlors, drins and chlordanes, has been evaluated in the Quequ{\'{e}}n Grande River agricultural watershed including different matrices. Soil profiles from fields dedicated to soybean cultures and the associated terrestrial biota (earthworms, coleopteran larvae, collembolan and mites), stream water, suspended particle matter and surface sediment were sampled during the pre-application pesticide period. Pesticide analyses were carried out using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. Soils samples showed a differential pesticide pattern throughout the profile. Control soils, settled 200 m from agricultural plots showed similar pesticide levels but with higher variety of compounds, denoting the historical use of OCPs in the zone. However, in agricultural plots DDTs and endosulfans constituted 90 {\%} of the pesticides found with a further enrichment of endosulfan sulfate at depth. The relatively high p,p′-DDT levels in surface agricultural soil would be a consequence of pesticide impurities in technical acaricide Dicofol, which is widely used in the region; and it represents a new threat of fresh p,p′-DDT input into environment despite its use being forbidden. Terrestrial biota, mainly mesofauna showed high capacity to OCP accumulation, the aforementioned organisms being a good option in the monitoring of trace pesticides. Furthermore, the high OCP levels found constitute a hazard to food web since these organisms are one of the first steps in the food chain and the biomagnification is a common process with these compounds. As a result of runoff and volatilization the occurrence of OCPs in the aquatic environment was observed, draining a load of around 7.3 kg of pesticides into the river annually. As a whole, these results suggest the importance of using terrestrial biota for studying recalcitrant pesticides and a continuous monitoring is strongly advised as a first step in minimizing environmental risks.},

abstract = {Aim: To estimate the concentrations, stoichiometry and storage of soil microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at biome and global scales. Location: Global. Method: We collected 3422 data points to summarize the concentrations and stoichiometry of C, N and P in soils, soil microbial biomass at global and biome levels, and to estimate the global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N. Results: The results show that concentrations of C, N and P in soils and soil microbial biomass vary substantially across biomes; the fractions of soil elements C, N and P in soil microbial biomass are 1.2, 2.6 and 8.0{\%}, respectively. The best estimates of C:N:P stoichiometry for soil elements and soil microbial biomass are 287:17:1 and 42:6:1, respectively, at global scale, and they vary in a wide range among biomes. The vertical distribution of soil microbial biomass follows the distribution of roots up to 1m depth. Main conclusions: The global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N were estimated to be 16.7 Pg C and 2.6 Pg N in the 0-30cm soil profiles, and 23.2 Pg C and 3.7 Pg N in the 0-100cm soil profiles. We did not estimate P in soil microbial biomass due to insufficient data and insignificant correlation between soil total P and climate variables used for spatial extrapolation. The spatial patterns of soil microbial biomass C and N were consistent with those of soil organic C and total N, i.e. high density in northern high latitude, and low density in low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

Because the factors regulating enzyme production are poorly understood, I used a simulation model to examine how competition, nutrient availability and spatial structure affect microbial growth and enzyme synthesis. In simulations where enzyme-producing microbes competed with cheaters (who do not synthesize enzymes but take-up product), higher enzyme costs favoured cheaters, while lower rates of enzyme diffusion favoured producers. Cheaters and producers coexisted in highly organized spatial patterns at intermediate enzyme costs and diffusion rates. Simulations with varying nutrient inputs showed that nitrogen supply can limit carbon mineralization, microbial growth and enzyme production because of the nitrogen-demanding stoichiometry of enzymes (C:N = c. 3.5:1). These results suggest that competition from cheaters, slow diffusion and nitrogen limitation may constrain microbial foraging and the enzymatic decomposition of complex compounds in natural environments. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

However, despite an immense amount of data generated, systematic, cross-environment analyses of microbiome responses to multiple disturbances are lacking. Here, we present the Microbiome Stress Project, an open-access database of environmental and host-associated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies collected to facilitate cross-study analyses of microbiome responses to stressors. This database will comprise published and unpublished datasets re-processed from the raw sequences into exact sequence variants using our standardized computational pipeline. Our database will provide insight into general response patterns of microbiome diversity, structure, and stability to environmental stressors. It will also enable the identification of cross-study associations between single or multiple stressors and specific microbial clades. Here, we present a proof-of-concept meta-analysis of 606 microbiomes (from nine studies) to assess microbial community responses to: (1) one stressor in one environment: soil warming across a variety of soil types, (2) a range of stressors in one environment: soil microbiome responses to a comprehensive set of stressors (incl. temperature, diesel, antibiotics, land use change, drought, and heavy metals), (3) one stressor across a range of environments: copper exposure effects on soil, sediment, activated-sludge reactors, and gut environments, and (4) the general trends of microbiome stressor responses. Overall, we found that stressor exposure significantly decreases microbiome alpha diversity and increases beta diversity (community dispersion) across a range of environments and stressor types. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between microbial community resistance to stressors (i.e. the average pairwise similarity score between the control and stressed communities) and alpha diversity. We used Phylofactor to identify microbial clades and individual taxa as potential bioindicators of copper contamination across different environments. Using standardized computational and statistical methods, the Microbiome Stress Project will leverage thousands of existing datasets to build a general framework for how microbial communities respond to environmental stress.},

The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. 13C-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in 13C-SIP incubations compared to 12C-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of 13C-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation. Active PHE-degraders act in a consortium, whereby complete PHE mineralization is achieved through the combined activity of taxonomically diverse co-occurring bacteria performing successive metabolic steps. Our study reveals hitherto underestimated functional interactions for full microbial detoxification in contaminated soils.},

By using rDNA clone libraries, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time PCR, both Dehalococcoides ethenogenes- and Dehalobacter restrictus-like 16S rDNA sequences were found within the community. Both species are known for reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene. Furthermore, numerous yet-uncultured members of the Green non-sulfur bacteria occurred within the consortium. The community analyses over a period of 14 months revealed a clear population shift. D. restrictus 16S rDNA was enriched significantly and became the most abundant rDNA sequence type, suggesting that Dehalobacter spp. play a key role within the reductive dechlorination of DCP in this consortium.

abstract = {This paper describes the application of mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis to predict the concentration of organic carbon fractions present in soil. The PLS calibrations were derived from a standard set of soils that had been analysed for total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and charcoal carbon (char-C) using physical and chemical means. PLS calibration models from this standard set of soils allowed the prediction of TOC, POC, and char-C fractions with a coefficient of determination (R2) of measured v. predicted data ranging between 0.97 and 0.73. For the POC fraction, the coefficient of determination could be improved (R2 = 0.94) through the use of local calibration sets. The capacity to estimate soil fractions such as char-C rapidly and inexpensively makes this approach highly attractive for studies where large numbers of analyses are required. Inclusion of a set of soils from Kenya demonstrated the robustness of the method for total organic carbon and charcoal carbon prediction. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2007.},

During the initial flush of decomposition, all constituent monosaccharides except for non cellulosic glucose were found to decrease. The amounts which disappeared were greater than the water extractable saccharides of the air dried soil or ground sample of the air dried soil. After the flush of decomposition, the changes in mannose, galactose, fucose and rhamnose were small, whereas cellulosic glucose, arabinose and xylose continued to decline in the upland field soil. The soil saccharides are classified into six groups and their relative persistency is discussed. The monosaccharide composition did not change markedly, but the proportion of monosaccharides relating to plant materials declined with time after incubation. The molar ratios of hexoses to pentoses, deoxyhexoses to pentoses, and non-cellulosic glucose to cellulosic glucose increased gradually, whereas a gradual decline in the ratio of xylose to mannose was observed when the soil received no plant materials under field conditions. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Biochemical properties related to heavy metal resistance and plant growth promotion were analyzed and compared with the Cr(VI)-resistant plant growth-promoting Delftia sp. JD2, previously reported by our group. Both isolates and JD2 were resistant to Cr(VI), Pb(II) and many antibiotics, produced siderophores and the phytohormone indole-3-acetic, and showed clover growth-promoting activity in greenhouse conditions. Interestingly, the occurrence of integron class 1 was shown in all isolates. Our results add to previous reports and suggest that bacteria of the genus Delftia could be consider as good candidates for the design of technologies for cleaning up contaminated environments and/or the production of biofertilizers.},

abstract = {Nutrition and pollution stress stimulate genetic adaptation in microorganisms and assist in evolution of diverse metabolic pathways for their survival on several complex organic compounds. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly lipophilic in nature and cause adverse effects to the environment and human health by biomagnification through the food chain. Diverse microorganisms, harboring numerous plasmids and catabolic genes, acclimatize to these environmentally unfavorable conditions by gene duplication, mutational drift, hypermutation, and recombination. Genetic aspects of some major POP catabolic genes such as biphenyl dioxygenase (bph), DDT 2,3-dioxygenase, and angular dioxygenase assist in degradation of biphenyl, organochlorine pesticides, and dioxins/furans, respectively. Microbial metagenome constitutes the largest genetic reservoir with miscellaneous enzymatic activities implicated in degradation. To tap the metabolic potential of microorganisms, recent techniques like sequence and function-based screening and substrate-induced gene expression are proficient in tracing out novel catabolic genes from the entire metagenome for utilization in enhanced biodegradation. The major endeavor of today's scientific world is to characterize the exact genetic mechanisms of microbes for bioremediation of these toxic compounds by excavating into the uncultured plethora. This review entails the effect of POPs on the environment and involvement of microbial catabolic genes for their removal with the advanced techniques of bioremediation.},

However, the impact of humic substances on the soil microbial community during the biotransformation of organic pollutants is expected to be crucial while remains to be unclear. In this study, the biostimulation of indigenous microbial communities and the consequent effects on anaerobic transformation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by a model humic substance, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), were systematically investigated in a paddy soil. The addition of AQDS was observed to increase the production of HCl-extractable Fe(II) and enhance the PCP transformation rates consequently. The pseudo-first-order rate constants of the PCP transformation showed a positive exponential relationship with the AQDS dosage. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) results indicated the substantial effect of added AQDS on soil microbial community. The enhanced abundance of Geobacter sp. was disclosed to be most critical for accelerated PCP transformation when with AQDS, in which Geobacter sp. functioned for promoting the generation of active Fe(II) and consequently enhancing the PCP transformation rates. The transformation rates of PCP were exponentially correlated with the abundance of Geobacter sp. positively. The findings are expected to improve the understanding of diversity and ubiquity of microorganisms in humic substances-rich soils for accelerating the transformations of soil chlorinated pollutants.},

abstract = {Long term residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soils are of great concerning because they seriously threaten food security and human health. This article focuses on isolation of OCP-degrading strains and their performance in bioremediation of contaminated soil under ex situ conditions. A bacterium, Chryseobacterium sp. PYR2, capable of degrading various OCPs and utilizing them as a sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from OCP-contaminated soil. In culture experiments, PYR2 degraded 80-98{\%} of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) or 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) isomers (50 mg L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) in 30 days. A pilot-scale ex situ bioremediation study of highly OCP-contaminated soil augmented with PYR2 was performed. During the 45-day experimental period, DDT concentration was reduced by 80.3{\%} in PYR2-augmented soils (35.37 mg kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 6.97 mg kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) but by only 57.6{\%} in control soils. Seven DDT degradation intermediates (metabolites) were detected and identified in PYR2-augmented soils: five by GC/MS: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDMS), and dichlorobenzophenone (DBP); and two by LC/MS: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA) and 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA). Levels of metabolites were fairly stable in control soils but varied greatly with time in PYR2-augmented soils. Levels of DDD, DDMU, and DDE in PYR2-augmented soils increased from day 0 to day 30 and then decreased by day 45. A DDT biodegradation pathway is proposed based on our identification of DDT metabolites in PYR2-augmented systems. PYR2 will be useful in future studies of OCP biodegradation and in bioremediation of OCP-contaminated soils.},

Here we describe PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states), a computational approach to predict the functional composition of a metagenome using marker gene data and a database of reference genomes. PICRUSt uses an extended ancestral-state reconstruction algorithm to predict which gene families are present and then combines gene families to estimate the composite metagenome. Using 16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene families in host-associated and environmental communities, with quantifiable uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that phylogeny and function are sufficiently linked that this 'predictive metagenomic' approach should provide useful insights into the thousands of uncultivated microbial communities for which only marker gene surveys are currently available. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract = {The influence of pH on the relative importance of the two principal decomposer groups in soil, fungi and bacteria, was investigated along a continuous soil pH gradient at Hoosfield acid strip at Rothamsted Research in the United Kingdom. This experimental location provides a uniform pH gradient, ranging from pH 8.3 to 4.0, within 180 m in a silty loam soil on which barley has been continuously grown for more than 100 years. We estimated the importance of fungi and bacteria directly by measuring acetate incorporation into ergosterol to measure fungal growth and leucine and thymidine incorporation to measure bacterial growth. The growth-based measurements revealed a fivefold decrease in bacterial growth and a fivefold increase in fungal growth with lower pH. This resulted in an approximately 30-fold increase in fungal importance, as indicated by the fungal growth/bacterial growth ratio, from pH 8.3 to pH 4.5. In contrast, corresponding effects on biomass markers for fungi (ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] 18:2omega6,9) and bacteria (bacterial PLFAs) showed only a two- to threefold difference in fungal importance in the same pH interval. The shift in fungal and bacterial importance along the pH gradient decreased the total carbon mineralization, measured as basal respiration, by only about one-third, possibly suggesting functional redundancy. Below pH 4.5 there was universal inhibition of all microbial variables, probably derived from increased inhibitory effects due to release of free aluminum or decreasing plant productivity. To investigate decomposer group importance, growth measurements provided significantly increased sensitivity compared with biomass-based measurements.},

We tested the effects of exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus inputs on litter decomposition across a broad suite of litter and soil types. In one experiment, C mineralization was compared across a wide array of plants individually added to a single soil, while in the second, C mineralization from a single substrate was compared across 50 soils. Counter to basic stoichiometric decomposition theory, low N availability can increase litter decomposition as microbes use labile substrates to acquire N from recalcitrant organic matter. This "microbial nitrogen mining" is consistently suppressed by high soil N supply or substrate N concentrations. There is no evidence for phosphorus mining as P fertilization increases short- and long-term mineralization. These results suggest that basic stoichiometric decomposition theory needs to be revised and ecosystem models restructured accordingly in order to predict ecosystem carbon storage responses to anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability.},

The closest phylogenetic relatives with validly published names were several strains of the genus Solirubrobacter and the species Conexibacter arvalis, with pairwise sequence similarities of ≤94.0 {\%}. Cells of strain D16/0/H6T were ovoid to rod-shaped, whereas strain A22/0/F9{\_}1T formed regular rods. Cells of both strains were motile and divided by binary fission. Colonies were pink and white to pale yellowish/brownish, respectively. Strains D16/0/H6T and A22/0/F9{\_}1T were aerobic, chemoheterotrophic mesophiles with broad temperature (13–43 and 17–43 °C, respectively) and pH (pH 4.5–8.5 and 5.0–9.5) ranges for growth. Complex proteinaceous substrates and glucose were the preferred carbon and energy sources. Strain A22/0/F9{\_}1T also grew on various carboxylic acids. For both strains, the peptidoglycan diamino acid was meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid. The major quinone was MK-8. As a minor compound, MK-7 occurred in strain D16/0/H6T; strain A22/0F9{\_}1T also contained MK-7, MK-7(H2) andMK-8(H2). Major fatty acids of strain D16/0/H6T were 10-methyl C17: 0, iso-C16: 0and C18: 1$\omega$9c. Strain A22/0F9{\_}1T contained C18: 1$\omega$9c, C17: 1$\omega$8c, C17: 1$\omega$6c and iso-C16: 0 as major components. The DNA G+C contents of strains D16/0/H6T and A22/0/F9{\_}1T were 72.8 and 74.0 mol{\%}, respectively. Based on these characteristics, the two isolates are assigned to novel species of the new genus Parviterribacter gen. nov., the type species Parviterribacter kavangonensis sp. nov.

The total ETCs determined in a H2/Pd reaction system greatly varied (112-392$\mu$molg-1) depending on the origin of the organic bulk material. Further analysis indicated that non-quinone (NQ) redox functional groups in HA accounted for an important fraction (25-44{\%}) of the total quantified ETCs.

abstract = {Differential abundance analysis is controversial throughout microbiome research. Gold standard approaches require laborious measurements of total microbial load, or absolute number of microorganisms, to accurately determine taxonomic shifts. Therefore, most studies rely on relative abundance data. Here, we demonstrate common pitfalls in comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total microbial load. We define the notion of “reference frames”, which provide deep intuition about the compositional nature of microbiome data. In an oral time series experiment, reference frames alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell-count normalized data. Furthermore, reference frames identify consistent, differentially abundant microbes previously undetected in two independent published datasets from subjects with atopic dermatitis. These methods allow reassessment of published relative abundance data to reveal reproducible microbial changes from standard sequencing output without the need for new assays.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important in a wide variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes in surface waters. We examined the relationship between DOC flux and soil C:N ratio on a biome basis. DOC fluxes for 164 rivers were subdivided into 15 biome types including tropical rain forest, coniferous forests, peatland, deciduous forests, mixed forests, and grasslands. A database of soil C:N ratios was constructed and subdivided into biome types. At a global scale, mean soil C:N ratio of a biome accounts for 99.2{\%} of the variance in annual riverine DOC flux among biomes. The relationship between soil C:N ratio and DOC flux at the biome scale was used to predict annual riverine DOC flux at the watershed scale for three test watersheds not included in the original model. Predicted flux of each watershed was within 4.5{\%} of the actual DOC flux. Using the C:N model, we estimated the total export of carbon from land to the oceans to be 3.6 × 1014 g yr-1. This empirical model should be useful in predicting changes in DOC flux under changing climatic conditions.},

abstract = {The nature of organic carbon in the {\textless}2, 2-20, 20-53, 53-200, and 200-2000 $\mu$m fractions of four surface soils was determined using solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectroscopy with cross polarisation and magic angle spinning (CP/MAS). Analyses were repeated after high energy ultraviolet photo-oxidation was performed on the three finest fractions. All four soils studied contained appreciable amounts of physically protected carbon while three of the soils contained even higher amounts of charcoal. It was not possible to measure the charcoal content of soils directly, however, after photo-oxidation, charcoal remained and was identified by its wood-like morphology revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) together with a highly aromatic chemistry determined by solid state 13C n.m.r. Charcoal appears to be the major contributor to the 130 ppm band seen in the n.m.r. spectra of many Australian soils. By using the aromatic region in the n.m.r. spectra, an approximate assessment of the charcoal distribution through the size fractions demonstrated that more than 88{\%} of the charcoal present in two of the soils occurred in the {\textless}53 $\mu$m fractions. These soils contained up to 0.8 g C as charcoal per 100 g of soil and up to 30{\%} of the soil carbon as charcoal. Humic acid extractions performed on soil fractions before and after photo-oxidation suggest that charcoal or charcoal-derived material may also contribute significantly to the aromatic signals found in the n.m.r. spectra of humic acids. Finely divided charcoal appears to be a major constituent of many Australian soils and probably contributes significantly to the inert or passive organic carbon pool recognised in carbon turnover models.},

abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

During the initial flush of decomposition, all constituent monosaccharides except for non cellulosic glucose were found to decrease. The amounts which disappeared were greater than the water extractable saccharides of the air dried soil or ground sample of the air dried soil. After the flush of decomposition, the changes in mannose, galactose, fucose and rhamnose were small, whereas cellulosic glucose, arabinose and xylose continued to decline in the upland field soil. The soil saccharides are classified into six groups and their relative persistency is discussed. The monosaccharide composition did not change markedly, but the proportion of monosaccharides relating to plant materials declined with time after incubation. The molar ratios of hexoses to pentoses, deoxyhexoses to pentoses, and non-cellulosic glucose to cellulosic glucose increased gradually, whereas a gradual decline in the ratio of xylose to mannose was observed when the soil received no plant materials under field conditions. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Performance of compost and biochar amendments for in situ risk mitigation of aged DDT, DDE and dieldrin residues in an old orchard soil was examined. The change in bioavailability of pesticide residues to Lumbricus terrestris L. relative to the unamended control soil was assessed using 4-L soil microcosms with and without plant cover in a 48-day experiment. The use of aged dairy manure compost and biosolids compost was found to be effective, especially in the planted treatments, at lowering the bioavailability factor (BAF) by 18-39{\%}; however, BAF results for DDT in the unplanted soil treatments were unaffected or increased. The pine chip biochar utilized in this experiment was ineffective at lower the BAF of pesticides in the soil. The US EPA Soil Screening Level approach was used with our measured values. Addition of 10{\%} of the aged dairy manure compost reduced the average hazard quotient values to below 1.0 for DDT + DDE and dieldrin. Results indicate this sustainable approach is appropriate to minimize risks to wildlife in areas of marginal organochlorine pesticide contamination. Application of this remediation approach has potential for use internationally in areas where historical pesticide contamination of soils remains a threat to wildlife populations.},

abstract = {Humins have been reported to function as an electron mediator for microbial reducing reactions. However, the physicochemical properties and the functional moieties of humins from different natural sources have been poorly characterized. In this study, humins extracted from seven types of soil and from a river sediment were examined on the effect on microbial reductive dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and characterized polyphasically. All humins facilitated microbial reductive dechlorination of PCP as electron mediators using formate as carbon source, with different dechlorination rates ranging from 0.99 to 7.63 ($\mu$molCl{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}d{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. The highest rates were observed in humins with high carbon contents, extracted from Andisols containing allophone as major clay. Yields of the humins and the elemental compositions varied among sources. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that all the humins exhibited similar spectra with different absorbance intensity; these data are indicative of their similar structures and identical classes of functional groups. The electron spin resonance spectra of humins prepared at different pH showed typical changes for the semiquinone-type radicals, suggestive of quinone moieties for the redox activity of the humins. Cyclic voltammetry analysis confirmed the presence of redox-active moieties in all the humins, with the estimated redox potentials in the range of -0.30 to -0.13V (versus a standard hydrogen electrode), falling into the range of standard redox potential between the oxidation of formate as electron donor and the initial dechlorination of PCP as electron acceptor.},

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of contexts on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of "authoritative" information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of "hub pages" that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.},

abstract = {When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time-to-event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R 2 , and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox-Snell R 2 , which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Long-term contrasts in agricultural management can shift soil resource availability with potential consequences to microbial carbon (C) use efficiency (CUE) and the fate of C in soils. Isothermal calorimetry was combined with 13 C-labeled glucose stable isotope probing (SIP) of 16S rRNA genes to test the hypothesis that organically managed soils would support microbial communities with greater thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional soils due to a legacy of lower resource availability and a resultant shift toward communities supportive of more oligotrophic taxa. Resource availability was greater in conventionally managed soils, with 3.5 times higher available phosphorus, 5{\%} more nitrate, and 36{\%} more dissolved organic C. The two management systems harbored distinct glucose-utilizing populations of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, with a higher Proteobacteria:Actinobacteria ratio (2.4 vs. 0.7) in conventional soils. Organically managed soils also harbored notable activity of Firmicutes. Thermodynamic efficiency indices were similar between soils, indicating that glucose was metabolized at similar energetic cost. However, differentially abundant glucose utilizers in organically managed soils were positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) priming and negatively correlated to soil nutrient and carbon availability, respiration, and heat production. These correlation patterns were strongly reversed in the conventionally managed soils indicating clear differentiation of microbial functioning related to soil resource availability. Fresh C addition caused proportionally more priming of SOM decomposition (57 vs. 51{\%}) in organically managed soils likely due to mineralization of organic nutrients to satisfy microbial demands during glucose utilization in these more resource deprived soils. The additional heat released from SOM oxidation may explain the similar community level thermodynamic efficiencies between management systems. Restoring fertility to soils with a legacy of nutrient limitation requires a balanced supply of both nutrients and energy to protect stable SOM from microbial degradation. These results highlight the need to consider managing C for the energy it provides to icritical biological processes that underpin soil health.},

abstract = {The use of equilibrium expressions for sorption to natural particles in fate and transport models is often invalid due to slow kinetics. This paper reviews recent research into the causes of slow sorption and desorption rates at the intraparticle level and how this phenomenon relates to contaminant transport, bio-availability, and remediation. Sorption kinetics are complex and poorly predictable at present. Diffusion limitations appear to play a major role. Contending mechanisms include diffusion through natural organic matter matrices and diffusion through intraparticle nanopores. These mechanisms probably operate si-multaneously, but the relative importance of each in a given system is indeterminate. Sorption shows anomalous behaviors that are presently not well explained by the simple diffusion models, including concentration dependence of the slow fraction, distributed rate constants, and kinetic hysteresis. Research is needed to determine whether adsorp-tion/desorption bond energies may play a role along with molecular diffusion in slow kinetics. The pos-sible existence of high-energy adsorption sites both within the internal matrix of organic matter and in nanopores is discussed. Sorption can be rate-limiting to biodegradation, bioavailablity, and subsurface transport of contaminants. Characterization of mech-anism is thus critical for fate and risk assessment. Studies are needed to measure desorption kinetics under digestive and respiratory conditions in receptor organisms. Conditions under which the constraint of slow desorption may be overcome are discussed, including the addition of biological or chemical agents, the application of heat, and the physical alteration of the soil.},

abstract = {Extracellular enzymes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play a key role in overall microbial activity, growth and survival in the ocean. EPS, being amphiphilic in nature, can act as biological surfactant in an oil spill situation. Extracellular enzymes help microbes to digest and utilize fractions of organic matter, including EPS, which can stimulate growth and enhance microbial activity. These natural processes might have been altered during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill due to the presence of hydrocarbon and dispersant. This study aims to investigate the role of bacterial extracellular enzymes during exposure to hydrocarbons and dispersant. Mesocosm studies were conducted using a water accommodated fraction of oil mixed with the chemical dispersant, Corexit (CEWAF) in seawater collected from two different locations in the Gulf of Mexico and corresponding controls (no additions). Activities of five extracellular enzymes typically found in the EPS secreted by the microbial community - $\alpha$- and $\beta$s-glucosidase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, leucine amino-peptidase - were measured using fluorogenic substrates in three different layers of the mesocosm tanks (surface, water column and bottom). Enhanced EPS production and extracellular enzyme activities were observed in the CEWAF treatment compared to the Control. Higher bacterial and micro-aggregate counts were also observed in the CEWAF treatment compared to Controls. Bacterial genera in the order Alteromonadaceae were the most abundant bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons recovered. Genomes of Alteromonadaceae commonly have alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase, therefore they may contribute significantly to the measured enzyme activities. Only Alteromonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae among bacteria detected here have higher percentage of genes for lipase. Piscirickettsiaceae was abundant; genomes from this order commonly have genes for leucine aminopeptidase. Overall, this study provides insights into the alteration to the microbial processes such as EPS and extracellular enzyme production, and to the microbial community, when exposed to the mixture of oil and dispersant.},

Methods: Lipid adjusted serum levels of 19 Dioxin Like (DL), 17 Non Dioxin Like (NDL) PCBs, 5 OCPs, and measures of complete blood count and routine biochemistry profile were obtained from the NHANES 2003-2004 cycle. For each of the PCB/OCP variables, individuals were put into four exposure groups and blood markers were compared across these groups. Results: Serum levels of PCBs and OCPs increased with age. Total white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin, and hematocrit measures were lowest in the group with the highest serum PCBs. Results for the OCPs varied. For Mirex, WBC declined in the highest exposure; no significant differences were observed for p-p'-DDT or p-p'-DDE; and higher levels of WBC were observed at the highest exposure groups of serum trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane. Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and GGT) were significantly higher in the highest exposure groups of PCBs/OCPs. Conclusions: We observed significant associations between PCB/OCP levels and blood markers in the general population. All of the levels were within normal ranges but the consistency of results is remarkable and may reflect subclinical effects. Largest differences were observed for NDL PCBs. Thus, routine application of toxic equivalency factors, which assume dioxin like mechanisms and aryl hydrocarbon receptor involvement, may not adequately reflect the effects of NDL PCBs in the mixture.},

Analyses were repeated after high energy ultraviolet photo-oxidation was performed on the three finest fractions. All four soils studied contained appreciable amounts of physically protected carbon while three of the soils contained even higher amounts of charcoal. It was not possible to measure the charcoal content of soils directly, however, after photo-oxidation, charcoal remained and was identified by its wood-like morphology revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) together with a highly aromatic chemistry determined by solid state 13C n.m.r. Charcoal appears to be the major contributor to the 130 ppm band seen in the n.m.r. spectra of many Australian soils. By using the aromatic region in the n.m.r. spectra, an approximate assessment of the charcoal distribution through the size fractions demonstrated that more than 88{\%} of the charcoal present in two of the soils occurred in the {\textless}53 $\mu$m fractions. These soils contained up to 0.8 g C as charcoal per 100 g of soil and up to 30{\%} of the soil carbon as charcoal. Humic acid extractions performed on soil fractions before and after photo-oxidation suggest that charcoal or charcoal-derived material may also contribute significantly to the aromatic signals found in the n.m.r. spectra of humic acids. Finely divided charcoal appears to be a major constituent of many Australian soils and probably contributes significantly to the inert or passive organic carbon pool recognised in carbon turnover models.},

We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of "hub pages" that join them together in the link structure.

abstract = {Background: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing reveals the potential in microbial communities. However, lower-cost 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing provides taxonomic, not functional, observations. To remedy this, we previously introduced Piphillin, a software package that predicts functional metagenomic content based on the frequency of detected 16S rRNA gene sequences corresponding to genomes in regularly updated, functionally annotated genome databases. Piphillin (and similar tools) have previously been evaluated on 16S rRNA data processed by the clustering of sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). New techniques such as amplicon sequence variant error correction are in increased use, but it is unknown if these techniques perform better in metagenomic content prediction pipelines, or if they should be treated the same as OTU data in respect to optimal pipeline parameters. Results: To evaluate the effect of 16S rRNA sequence analysis method (clustering sequences into OTUs vs amplicon sequence variant error correction into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)) on the ability of Piphillin to predict functional metagenomic content, we evaluated Piphillin-predicted functional content from 16S rRNA sequence data processed through OTU clustering and error correction into ASVs compared to corresponding shotgun metagenomic data. We show a strong correlation between metagenomic data and Piphillin-predicted functional content resulting from both 16S rRNA sequence analysis methods. Differential abundance testing with Piphillin-predicted functional content exhibited a low false positive rate ({\textless} 0.05) while capturing a large fraction of the differentially abundant features resulting from corresponding metagenomic data. However, Piphillin prediction performance was optimal at different cutoff parameters depending on 16S rRNA sequence analysis method. Using data analyzed with amplicon sequence variant error correction, Piphillin outperformed comparable tools, for instance exhibiting 19{\%} greater balanced accuracy and 54{\%} greater precision compared to PICRUSt2. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that raw Illumina sequences should be processed for subsequent Piphillin analysis using amplicon sequence variant error correction (with DADA2 or similar methods) and run using a 99{\%} ID cutoff for Piphillin, while sequences generated on platforms other than Illumina should be processed via OTU clustering (e.g., UPARSE) and run using a 96{\%} ID cutoff for Piphillin.

abstract = {Current approaches to modelling the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment have evolved in response to four dominant characteristics of these substances; namely: (1) the presence of POPs in virtually all environmental phases and the ease with which they move from one to the other requires multi-compartmental modelling. Describing transport across phase boundaries becomes as, or even more, important as quantifying transport within the phases; (2) POPs may persist in the environment for many decades. For chemicals that 'have time', concepts such as equilibrium partitioning and steady-state become more important than for short-lived substances whose fate is more controlled by the rates of transformation; (3) measuring POPs is difficult and expensive and observed concentrations of POPs are not available in high spatial or temporal resolution. Consequently, high resolution tends not to be a high priority in POP models; and (4) detrimental effects of POPs often manifest themselves in top predators, which has led to a focus on modelling biotic uptake and transfer within food chains. The task of building a POPs model is viewed as combining the four 'building blocks' of partitioning, transport, transformation and source data with the help of the law of the conservation of mass. Process models, evaluative models, models of real local, regional and global fate, as well as biological uptake models are presented and references to numerous examples are provided. An attempt is made to forecast future directions in the field of POPs modelling. It is expected that modelling techniques that do not rely on quantitative emission estimates as well as approaches that take into account spatial, temporal and climatic variability as well as parameter uncertainty will increase in importance. Finally, the relationship between modelling POPs and models of other pollutant issues is addressed, as are potential interactions between POPs and pollutant issues such as eutrophication, acidification and global climate change.},

Strain PD653 also degraded hexachlorobenzene (HCB) with a liberation of chloride ions to CO 2 under aerobic conditions. It is the first aerobic bacteria capable of mineralizing HCB. Moreover, an aerobic dieldrin-degrading fungus, Mucor sp. strain DDF, was isolated from soil to which endosulfan had been applied annually for many years. Strain DDF degraded dieldrin to 1.01 $\mu$M from 14.3 $\mu$M during 10-day incubation at 25°C. On the other hand, the application technology remains inadequate for remediating contaminated sites. Therefore, we developed a method to introduce the degrading-bacterial consortium into contaminated soil using a special charcoal material that enriched the soil with a methylthio-s-triazine degrading bacterium and the chloro-s-triazine degrading bacterial consortium CD7. For in situ bioremediation study, the enriched charcoal with CD7 was used at a contaminated site with simazine.

abstract = {The mineralogy of the clay fraction of soils is a major determinant of the behavior of soil. Conventionally these clay minerals have been determined using techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), but new complementary methods such as infrared spectroscopy can be used to rapidly and economically predict these minerals. This paper presents a methodology to predict these clay minerals at high-resolution that adhere to GlobalSoilMap (GSM) standards. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic models were formulated for clay minerals kaolinite, illite and smectite using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and legacy quantitative XRD determinations. Very strong models were achieved for kaolinite, illite and smectite and the root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) were all {\textless} 12 wt.{\%}. Spectroscopic models were applied to 11,500 samples from western Victoria and harmonized to the GSM specified depth intervals using equal area splines. Clay minerals were then mapped using data mining model trees with a 10-fold cross validation to derive a mean prediction estimate and 90{\%} prediction interval. Spatial models accounted for 26 to 77{\%} of the total variation with kaolinite predictions for all 6 GSM depths ≥ 65{\%}. Kaolinite is the dominant soil clay mineral of western Victoria for uplands and weathered volcanic terrains. Illite concentrations are higher where associated with weathered granitic plutons and in aeolian deposits of semi-arid environments. Smectite tends to occur associated with depressions of plains (volcanic and sedimentary). Further supplementation of additional sites and samples for landscapes with relatively sparse observations should contribute to refined and improved maps of these clay minerals.},

abstract = {The susceptibility of dioxins to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-mediated dechlorination reactions was investigated using 1,2,3,4,6,7,9- heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), Aldrich humic acid (AHA), and polymaleic acid (PMA) as model compounds. The dechlorination yields were on the order of 4-20{\%} which, when normalized to phenolic acidity, was comparable to yields observed in the presence of the humic constituents catechol and resorcinol. Based on the ratio of dechlorination yields as a function of phenolic acidity and electron transfer capacity, differences in electron transfer efficiency to dioxins are likely combined effects of specific interactions with the functional groups and nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Hexa- and penta CDD homologues were dominant in all incubations, and diCDD constituted the final product of dechlorination. The rates of appearance of lesser chlorinated products (pMnM/d) were similar to those observed in sediment systems and followed thermodynamic considerations as they decreased with a decrease in level of chlorination. Generally, both absolute and phenolic acidity-normalized rate constants for AHA-mediated reactions were up to 2- fold higher than those effected by PMA. These results indicate that the electron shuttling capacity of sediment DOC may significantly affect the fate of dioxins, in part through dechlorination reactions.},

abstract = {Plant growth can be an important factor regulating seasonal variations of soil microbial biomass and activity. We investigated soil microbial biomass, microbial respiration, net N mineralization, and soil enzyme activity in turfgrass systems of three cool-season species (tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb., Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., and creeping bentgrass, Agrostis palustris L.) and three warm-season species (centipedegrass, Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro.) Hack, zoysiagrass, Zoysia japonica Steud, and bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.). Microbial biomass and respiration were higher in warm- than the cool-season turfgrass systems, but net N mineralization was generally lower in warm-season turfgrass systems. Soil microbial biomass C and N varied seasonally, being lower in September and higher in May and December, independent of turfgrass physiological types. Seasonal variations in microbial respiration, net N mineralization, and cellulase activity were also similar between warm- and cool-season turfgrass systems. The lower microbial biomass and activity in September were associated with lower soil available N, possibly caused by turfgrass competition for this resource. Microbial biomass and activity (i.e., microbial respiration and net N mineralization determined in a laboratory incubation experiment) increased in soil samples collected during late fall and winter when turfgrasses grew slowly and their competition for soil N was weak. These results suggest that N availability rather than climate is the primary determinant of seasonal dynamics of soil microbial biomass and activity in turfgrass systems, located in the humid and warm region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized microbiome research by allowing the relative quantification of microbiome composition and function in different environments. In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest. We do this by acknowledging the compositional nature of the microbiome and the fact that it carries relative information. Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal , a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn's microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study. IMPORTANCE We propose a new algorithm for the identification of microbial signatures. These microbial signatures can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prediction of therapeutic response based on an individual's specific microbiota.},

Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (OC) exists as a diverse mixture of organic materials with different susceptibilities to biological decomposition. Computer simulation models constructed to predict the dynamics of soil OC have dealt with this diversity using a series of conceptual pools differentiated from one another by the magnitude of their respective decomposition rate constants. Research has now shown that the conceptual pools can be replaced by measureable fractions of soil OC separated on the basis of physical and chemical properties. In this study, an automated protocol for allocating soil OC to coarse ({\textgreater}50$\mu$m) and fine (≤50$\mu$m) fractions was assessed. Automating the size fractionation process was shown to reduce operator dependence and variability between replicate analyses. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to quantify the content of biologically resistant poly-aryl carbon in the coarse and fine size fractions. Cross-polarisation analyses were completed for coarse and fine fractions of 312 soils, and direct polarisation analyses were completed for 38 representative fractions. Direct polarisation analyses indicated that the resistant poly-aryl carbon was under-represented in the cross-polarisation analyses, on average, by a factor of ∼2. Combining this under-representation with a spectral analysis process allowed the proportion of coarse- and fine-fraction OC existing as resistant poly-aryl C to be defined. The content of resistant OC was calculated as the sum of that found in the coarse and fine fractions. Contents of particulate and humus OC were calculated after subtracting the resistant OC from the coarse and fine fractions, respectively. Across the 312 soils analysed, substantial variations in the contents of humus, particulate, and resistant carbon were noted, with respective average values of 9.4, 4.0, and 4.5g fraction C/kg soil obtained. When expressed as a proportion of the OC present in each soil, the humus, particulate, and resistant OC accounted for 56, 19, and 26{\%}, respectively. The nuclear magnetic resonance analyses also indicated that the use of a 50-$\mu$m sieve to differentiate particulate ({\textgreater}50$\mu$m) from humus (≤50$\mu$m) forms of OC provided an effective separation based on extents of decomposition. The procedures developed in this study provided a means to differentiate three biologically significant forms of soil OC based on size, extent of decomposition, and chemical composition (poly-aryl content). {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2013.},

The obtained data show that organic matter fractions differ according to particle-size distribution and vegetations. Being more aliphatic, clay-size fractions were significantly different from bulk soils. Sand-size fractions generally gave very similar results to bulk soils. Alkyl-C (mainly polymethylene) increased from coarse sand ({\textgreater}250 $\mu$m) to clay ({\textless}2 $\mu$m) particles size in all sites, suggesting an accumulation of recalcitrant material in fine particle-size fraction. O-Alkyl-C (mainly carbohydrate) content decreased from coarse to fine particle size under the hemlock forest, whereas no consistent trend was found in dwarfed bamboo grassland soils. High amounts ({\textgreater}35{\%}) of O-alkyl-C in all particle-size fractions in dwarfed bamboo grassland soils were attributed to that of the linkage of phenolic acids to cell-wall polysaccharides in bamboo litter. Based on a humification index of alkyl/O-alkyl-C, the humification degrees in particle-size fractions are in the order: clay〉fine silt〉coarse silt〉fine sand〉coarse sand in both of hemlock forest and dwarfed bamboo grassland soil. The alkyl/ O-alkyl-C ratios in hemlock forest soil were consistently higher than those in dwarfed bamboo grassland soils, suggesting that humification of SOM is higher in the forest soil than in the dwarfed bamboo grassland soils. The 13C NMR analysis and the change of C/N ratio of the particle-size fractions indicate that the accumulation of recalcitrant material in fine particle size favors alkyl-C rather than aromatic-C in these subalpine soils. The low content of aromatic-C in soil might be due to the high precipitation in this subalpine area. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the effect of biofumigation (with sheep and chicken manure) combined with solarization on the dissipation of pesticides (pyrifenox, DDT and dieldrin), and on soil metals accumulation. The treatments consisted of a control, and soil disinfestations by biofumigation combined with solarization (B+S) for two, four, five, six consecutive years. B+S enhanced the dissipation of pyrifenox with regard to control treatment. Significant differences were not detected among plots disinfected with B+S for consecutive years. On the other hand, B+S had no effect on the dissipation of DDT and dieldrin, probably due to the resistance of these pesticides to microbial degradation and/or high temperatures. Biofumigation is considered to be an environmentally safe practice, since no accumulation of heavy metals such as Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, or Zn was observed after the subsequent application of organic matter through the treatments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Journal of Statistical Software. All right reserved. When testing for reduction of the mean value structure in linear mixed models, it is common to use an asymptotic $\chi$ 2  test. Such tests can, however, be very poor for small and moderate sample sizes. The pbkrtest package implements two alternatives to such approximate $\chi$ 2  tests: The package implements (1) a Kenward-Roger approximation for performing F tests for reduction of the mean structure and (2) parametric bootstrap methods for achieving the same goal. The implementation is focused on linear mixed models with independent residual errors. In addition to describing the methods and aspects of their implementation, the paper also contains several examples and a comparison of the various methods.},

abstract = {Long term residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soils are of great concerning because they seriously threaten food security and human health. This article focuses on isolation of OCP-degrading strains and their performance in bioremediation of contaminated soil under ex situ conditions. A bacterium, Chryseobacterium sp. PYR2, capable of degrading various OCPs and utilizing them as a sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from OCP-contaminated soil. In culture experiments, PYR2 degraded 80-98{\%} of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) or 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) isomers (50 mg L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) in 30 days. A pilot-scale ex situ bioremediation study of highly OCP-contaminated soil augmented with PYR2 was performed. During the 45-day experimental period, DDT concentration was reduced by 80.3{\%} in PYR2-augmented soils (35.37 mg kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 6.97 mg kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) but by only 57.6{\%} in control soils. Seven DDT degradation intermediates (metabolites) were detected and identified in PYR2-augmented soils: five by GC/MS: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDMS), and dichlorobenzophenone (DBP); and two by LC/MS: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA) and 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA). Levels of metabolites were fairly stable in control soils but varied greatly with time in PYR2-augmented soils. Levels of DDD, DDMU, and DDE in PYR2-augmented soils increased from day 0 to day 30 and then decreased by day 45. A DDT biodegradation pathway is proposed based on our identification of DDT metabolites in PYR2-augmented systems. PYR2 will be useful in future studies of OCP biodegradation and in bioremediation of OCP-contaminated soils.},

One way to accomplish this is with the use of mixed cultures of microorganisms constructed on the basis of synergistic and commensalistic relationships. However, degradation of a surfactant by one member of a commensalistic consortium may lead to the production of toxic or non-toxic metabolites. Waste water treatment without the build up of such metabolites can be achieved in plants operated with sludge retention times that are suitable for maintaining all microorganisms of the consortium. Contrary to this in natural ecosystems, the introduction of a surfactant may result in a transient formation of a metabolite.},

abstract = {Nutrition and pollution stress stimulate genetic adaptation in microorganisms and assist in evolution of diverse metabolic pathways for their survival on several complex organic compounds. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly lipophilic in nature and cause adverse effects to the environment and human health by biomagnification through the food chain. Diverse microorganisms, harboring numerous plasmids and catabolic genes, acclimatize to these environmentally unfavorable conditions by gene duplication, mutational drift, hypermutation, and recombination. Genetic aspects of some major POP catabolic genes such as biphenyl dioxygenase (bph), DDT 2,3-dioxygenase, and angular dioxygenase assist in degradation of biphenyl, organochlorine pesticides, and dioxins/furans, respectively. Microbial metagenome constitutes the largest genetic reservoir with miscellaneous enzymatic activities implicated in degradation. To tap the metabolic potential of microorganisms, recent techniques like sequence and function-based screening and substrate-induced gene expression are proficient in tracing out novel catabolic genes from the entire metagenome for utilization in enhanced biodegradation. The major endeavor of today's scientific world is to characterize the exact genetic mechanisms of microbes for bioremediation of these toxic compounds by excavating into the uncultured plethora. This review entails the effect of POPs on the environment and involvement of microbial catabolic genes for their removal with the advanced techniques of bioremediation.},

abstract = {Repeated pesticide exposure may enhance biodegradation through selective enrichment of pesticide-metabolizing microorganisms, particularly when the compound is used as a C and energy source. The relationship between pesticide application history and degradation rate is unclear when the chemical is utilized as a nutrient source other than C. Atrazine, a poor source of C and energy, was chosen as a model compound because it can serve as an N source for some microorganisms. Soils with (H-soil) and without (NH-soil) prior s-triazine treatment history were repeatedly exposed to atrazine and a variety of C and N source amendments. Exposure to atrazine and inorganic-N availability were the dominant factors leading to the development of microbial communities with an enhanced capacity to degrade atrazine. The density of the atrazine-degrading microorganisms increased immediately, up to 1000-fold, with atrazine exposure in the H-soil, but comparable increases were not observed in the NH-soil until 12 weeks following laboratory acclimation, despite high rates of atrazine mineralization in these soils immediately following the acclimation period. Whole-soil fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed that the application of alternative C and N sources in addition to atrazine resulted in a microbial community composition that was distinctly different from that in either the atrazinealone treatment or water controls for both the H- and NH-soils. These data suggest that the microbial communities in both soils were altered differently in response to the treatments but developed a similar enhanced capacity to mineralize atrazine.},

In the present study, 12 different samples of humic acids (HA) were extracted from a wide diversity of organic rich environments, including soil from different forests and plantations, and were characterized based on their elemental composition, carboxyl and phenolic content, FTIR spectra and their electron transferring capacities (ETCs). The total ETCs determined in a H2/Pd reaction system greatly varied (112-392$\mu$molg-1) depending on the origin of the organic bulk material. Further analysis indicated that non-quinone (NQ) redox functional groups in HA accounted for an important fraction (25-44{\%}) of the total quantified ETCs. Results derived from the present study constitute the first demonstration that humus-reducing microorganisms are capable of reducing both quinone and NQ redox functional groups in different HA samples and expand our understanding on the microbial reduction of humic substances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the conditions that promote the growth and activity of pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP)-degrading microorganisms within mixed microbial systems are needed to shape microbiomes in biotreatment reactors and manage process performance. Available carbon sources influence microbial community structure, and specific carbon sources could potentially be added to end-of-treatment train biotreatment systems (e.g., soil aquifer treatment [SAT]) to select for the growth and activity of a range of microbial phylotypes that collectively degrade target PPCPs. Herein, the impacts of primary carbon sources on PPCP biodegradation and microbial community structure were explored to identify promising carbon sources for PPCP biotreatment application. Six types of primary carbon sources were investigated: casamino acids, two humic acid and peptone mixtures (high and low amounts of humic acid), molasses, an organic acids mixture, and phenol. Biodegradation was tracked for five PPCPs (diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and triclosan). Primary carbon sources were found to differentially impact microbial community structures and rates and efficiencies of PPCP biotransformation. Of the primary carbon sources tested, casamino acids, organic acids, and phenol showed the fastest biotransformation; however, on a biomass-normalized basis, both humic acid-peptone mixtures showed comparable or superior biotransformation. By comparing microbial communities for the different primary carbon sources, abundances of unclassified Beijerinckiaceae, Beijerinckia, Sphingomonas, unclassified Sphingomonadaceae, Flavobacterium, unclassified Rhizobiales, and Nevskia were statistically linked with biotransformation of specific PPCPs.},

abstract = {For nearly a century, scientific advances have fueled progress in U.S. agriculture to enable American producers to deliver safe and abundant food domestically and provide a trade surplus in bulk and high-value agricultural commodities and foods. Today, the U.S. food and agricultural enterprise faces formidable challenges that will test its long-term sustainability, competitiveness, and resilience. On its current path, future productivity in the U.S. agricultural system is likely to come with trade-offs. The success of agriculture is tied to natural systems, and these systems are showing signs of stress, even more so with the change in climate. More than a third of the food produced is unconsumed, an unacceptable loss of food and nutrients at a time of heightened global food demand. Increased food animal production to meet greater demand will generate more greenhouse gas emissions and excess animal waste. The U.S. food supply is generally secure, but is not immune to the costly and deadly shocks of continuing outbreaks of food-borne illness or to the constant threat of pests and pathogens to crops, livestock, and poultry. U.S. farmers and producers are at the front lines and will need more tools to manage the pressures they face. Science Breakthroughs to Advance Food and Agricultural Research by 2030 identifies innovative, emerging scientific advances for making the U.S. food and agricultural system more efficient, resilient, and sustainable. This report explores the availability of relatively new scientific developments across all disciplines that could accelerate progress toward these goals. It identifies the most promising scientific breakthroughs that could have the greatest positive impact on food and agriculture, and that are possible to achieve in the next decade (by 2030).},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important in a wide variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes in surface waters. We examined the relationship between DOC flux and soil C:N ratio on a biome basis. DOC fluxes for 164 rivers were subdivided into 15 biome types including tropical rain forest, coniferous forests, peatland, deciduous forests, mixed forests, and grasslands. A database of soil C:N ratios was constructed and subdivided into biome types. At a global scale, mean soil C:N ratio of a biome accounts for 99.2{\%} of the variance in annual riverine DOC flux among biomes. The relationship between soil C:N ratio and DOC flux at the biome scale was used to predict annual riverine DOC flux at the watershed scale for three test watersheds not included in the original model. Predicted flux of each watershed was within 4.5{\%} of the actual DOC flux. Using the C:N model, we estimated the total export of carbon from land to the oceans to be 3.6 × 1014 g yr-1. This empirical model should be useful in predicting changes in DOC flux under changing climatic conditions.},

This review describes rhamnolipid biosynthesis and potential industrial and environmental applications of rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipid production is dependent on central metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis and dTDP-activated sugars, as well as on enzymes participating in the production of the exopolysaccharide alginate. Synthesis of these surfactants is regulated by a very complex genetic regulatory system that also controls different P. aeruginosa virulence-associated traits. Rhamnolipids have several potential industrial and environmental applications including the production of fine chemicals, the characterization of surfaces and surface coatings, as additives for environmental remediation, and as a biological control agent. Realization of this wide variety of applications requires economical commercial-scale production of rhamnolipids.},

abstract = {An aerobic dieldrin-degrading fungus, Mucor racemosus strain DDF, was isolated from a soil to which endosulfan had been annually applied for more than 10 years until 2008. Strain DDF degraded dieldrin to 1.01 microM from 14.3 microM during a 10-day incubation at 25 degrees C. Approximately 0.15 microM (9{\%}) of aldrin trans-diol was generated from the dieldrin degradation after a 1-day incubation. The degradation of dieldrin by strain DDF was detected over a broad range of pH and concentrations of glucose and nitrogen sources. Extracellular fluid without mycelia also degraded dieldrin. Strain DDF degraded not only dieldrin but also heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, DDT, and DDE. Endosulfan sulfate and heptachlor were degraded by 0.64 microM (95{\%}) and 0.75 microM (94{\%}), respectively, whereas endosulfan and DDE were degraded by 2.42 microM (80{\%}) and 3.29 microM (79{\%}), respectively, and DDT and heptachlor epoxide were degraded by 6.95 microM (49.3{\%}) and 5.36 microM (67.5{\%}), respectively, compared with the control, which had a concentration of approximately 14 microM. These results suggest that strain DDF could be a candidate for the bioremediation of sites contaminated with various persistent organochlorine pesticides including POPs.},

One way to accomplish this is with the use of mixed cultures of microorganisms constructed on the basis of synergistic and commensalistic relationships. However, degradation of a surfactant by one member of a commensalistic consortium may lead to the production of toxic or non-toxic metabolites. Waste water treatment without the build up of such metabolites can be achieved in plants operated with sludge retention times that are suitable for maintaining all microorganisms of the consortium. Contrary to this in natural ecosystems, the introduction of a surfactant may result in a transient formation of a metabolite.},

abstract = {Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, has been introduced into agricultural soils via irrigation with treated wastewater and biosolids application. Such contamination is problematic because CBZ is persistent and the risks to ecosystems or human health are unknown. The current study examined CBZ biodegradation in two agricultural soils (soil 1 and 2) and the effects on the soil microbial communities during CBZ exposure. The experimental design involved three CBZ concentrations (50, 500, 5000 ng/g), under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. CBZ concentrations were determined using solid phase extraction and LC MS/MS. The effect of CBZ on the soil microbial community was investigated using high throughput sequencing and a computational approach to predict functional composition of the metagenomes (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states, PICRUSt). The most significant CBZ biodegradation occurred in soil 1 under aerobic conditions. In contrast, CBZ biodegradation was limited under anaerobic conditions in soil 1 and under both conditions in soil 2. For soil 1, several phylotypes were enriched following CBZ degradation compared to the controls, including unclassified Sphingomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, as well as Sphingomonas, Aquicella and Microvirga. These phylotypes are considered putative CBZ degraders as they appear to be benefiting from CBZ biodegradation. PICRUSt revealed that soil 1 contained a greater abundance of xenobiotic degrading genes compared to soil 2, and thus, this analysis method offers a potential valuable approach for predicting CBZ attenuation in soils. PICRUSt analysis also implicated Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae in drug metabolism. Interestingly, numerous phylotypes decreased in abundance following CBZ exposure and these varied with soil type, concentration, duration of exposure, and the availability of oxygen. For three phylotypes (Flavobacterium, 3 genus incertae sedis and unclassified Bacteroidetes), the relative abundance was reduced in both soils, indicating a notable sensitivity to CBZ for these microorganisms.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of selected electron donors and electron acceptors on the anaerobic biodegradation of DDT and its major metabolites in a muck soil with a long history of exposure to the pesticide. Loss of DDT was measured in anaerobic microcosms supplemented with H2, lactate, and acetate. The greatest loss of DDT (approximately 87 {\%}) was observed in microcosms amended with lactate and no additional electron acceptor compared to the no additional electron donor or acceptor sets. An increase in measureable concentrations of DDx was observed in un-amended microcosms. In larger scale mesocosms, significant increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) corresponded with low redox potentials. Increases in DOC corresponded with sharp increases in measured concentrations of DDx, followed by a decrease in measured DDT concentrations in lactate-amended mesocosms. Our studies indicate that sorbed DDx is released upon anaerobic incubation, and that indigenous microorganisms capable of DDx degradation respond to lactate additions. Both the potential for release of sorbed DDx and the potential for biodegradation of DDx should be considered during remediation of DDx-contaminated organic soils at low redox potentials. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

It is a sub-discipline of ecology, not of statistics or other mathematical discipline. Many of the methods used in numerical ecology have been developed by ecologists, specialists of classification methods, geneticists and other researchers who were facing questions about multivariate data in their fields of study. The field of numerical ecology results from the work of a large number of dedicated scientists who experimented with numerical methods of analysis before and in the computer era. They developed a broad palette of methods of analysis to answer specific ecological questions. The article lists some of the pioneer researchers, as well as the scientists who wrote the first textbooks describing how numerical and statistical analysis of ecological data could and should be done to answer ecological questions and test hypotheses. The field is also indebted to the scientists who developed the many computer packages now available for numerical analysis of ecological data.},

@article{Reineke2001,
abstract = {Microorganisms represent essential components of the global carbon cycle. In addition, it appears that most xenobiotic industrial chemicals can be degraded by microorganisms, either by a combination of cometabolic steps, often yielding partial degradation, or by serving as growth substrate which is accompanied by mineralization of at least part of the molecule. Using a number of examples, including aromatic, chloroaromatic, aliphatic, and chloroaliphatic compounds, I have presented some principles on the degradation. The great influence of some environmental conditions on the degradation, such as the presence or absence of oxygen, the availability of other electron acceptors such as nitrate or sulfate, has been discussed with special emphasis on the type of reactions and the rates of degradation that occur. While aerobic microorganisms use oxidative reactions, the degradation by anaerobic bacteria takes place by reductive types of reactions. The oxidative sequences of aromatic and chloroaromatic compounds in aerobic bacteria yield central intermediates with a diphenolic structure. These compounds are then cleaved by enzymes that use molecular oxygen. In contrast, the anaerobes degrade aromatic compounds by reductive conversions and the central intermediates ready for hydrolytic ring cleavage bear a 1,3-dioxo structure. Aerobic bacteria and fungi, especially ligninolytic ones, were shown to use mechanistically different catabolic pathways and enzymes. The ligninolytic fungi convert oxygen to hydrogen peroxide which is then used for the formation of an aryl cation radical undergoing spontaneous rearrangements and degradation. The broad variety of mechanisms which brings about dechlorination is another important part of this work.Although the diversity of the compounds discussed is very large, the strategy of the organisms used in the degradation includes various analogous reactions. Another important aspect of discussion is the different degree of degradation.While most research is done on organisms that are able to use the respective compound as the growth substrate, i.e., carbon dioxide and biomass result, the cometabolic potential of microorganisms should not be neglected. Cometabolism takes place very much in nature and brings about some modification of a target compound. In general, anoxic microbial degradation seems to be of greater relevance in nature than earlier expected. It is remarkable that some chlorinated compounds such as chlorobenzoates, chlorophenols, or tetrachloroethene may function as a physiologically functional electron acceptor in a type of anaerobic respiration,which leads to non-chlorinated or lower chlorinated products. Since various compounds will not be degraded totally by one type of organism the complementary potential of anaerobic and aerobic populations in combination is thought to be a method to bring about complete mineralization. Finally, the possibility of enhancing the degradative potential of aerobic organisms in the laboratory, i.e., artificial evolution of enzymes and pathways, by different genetic approaches, is discussed.},

abstract = {The capacity of biochars derived from agricultural wastes to remove Cd(II) and Cu(II) from aqueous solution and contaminated mine water was evaluated using laboratory-based batch sorption experiments. To examine immobilization of heavy metals, biochars produced in a commercial-scale mobile pyrolizer from feedstocks: poultry litter; lucerne shoot; vetch shoot; canola shoot; wheat straws; and sugar-gum wood, were tested in a liquid-based system. Biochars were characterized by FTIR, XPS and XRD before and after the mine water treatment. Lucerne biochar had the highest Langmuir sorption capacity of Cd(II) (6.28 mg g−1) and vetch-derived biochar had the highest Cu(II) sorption capacity (18.0 mg g−1) at pH 5.5. All the biochars exhibited higher sorption capacity for Cu(II) than for Cd(II). The smaller ionic radius and higher electronegativity of Cu(II), and the PO43−, CO32− and N-containing functional groups of biochars enhanced their binding affinity. The results demonstrated that poultry litter-derived biochar was effective at removal of the Cd(II) and Cu(II) from mine water up to the levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. The results revealed that precipitation with CO32− and PO43−, complexation with –OH and –COOH groups and electrostatic interaction with O-containing surface functional groups were the main mechanisms involved in the removal of multi-metals by biochars, and that selection of feedstock materials for biochar production is important to maximise remediation of multi-metals in contaminated water.},

abstract = {Phytoremediation is an attractive alternative to conventional treatments of soil due to advantages such as low cost, large application areas, and the possibility of in situ treatment. This study presents the assessment of phytoremediation processes conducted under controlled experimental conditions to evaluate the ability of Ricinus communis L., tropical plant species, to promote the degradation of 15 persistent organic pollutants (POPs), in a 66-day period. The contaminants tested were hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), DDT, heptachlor, aldrin, and others. Measurements made in rhizosphere soil indicate that the roots of the studied species reduce the concentration of pesticides. Results obtained during this study indicated that the higher the hydrophobicity of the organic compound and its molecular interaction with soil or root matrix the greater its tendency to concentrate in root tissues and the research showed the following trend: HCHs {\textless} diclofop-methyl {\textless} chlorpyrifos {\textless} methoxychlor {\textless} heptachlor epoxide {\textless} endrin {\textless} o,p'-DDE {\textless} heptachlor {\textless} dieldrin {\textless} aldrin {\textless} o, p'-DDT {\textless} p, p'-DDT by increasing order of log K-ow values.

abstract = {A bacterium designated Pseudonocardia sp. strain ENV478 was isolated by enrichment culturing on tetrahydrofuran (THF) and was screened to determine its ability to degrade a range of ether pollutants. After growth on THF, strain ENV478 degraded THF (63 mg/h/g total suspended solids [TSS]), 1,4-dioxane (21 mg/h/g TSS), 1,3-dioxolane (19 mg/h/g TSS), bis-2-chloroethylether (BCEE) (12 mg/h/g TSS), and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (9.1 mg/h/g TSS). Although the highest rates of 1,4-dioxane degradation occurred after growth on THF, strain ENV478 also degraded 1,4-dioxane after growth on sucrose, lactate, yeast extract, 2-propanol, and propane, indicating that there was some level of constitutive degradative activity. The BCEE degradation rates were about threefold higher after growth on propane (32 mg/h/g TSS) than after growth on THF, and MTBE degradation resulted in accumulation of tert-butyl alcohol. Degradation of 1,4-dioxane resulted in accumulation of 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (2HEAA). Despite its inability to grow on 1,4-dioxane, strain ENV478 degraded this compound for {\textgreater} 80 days in aquifer microcosms. Our results suggest that the inability of strain ENV478 and possibly other THF-degrading bacteria to grow on 1,4-dioxane is related to their inability to efficiently metabolize the 1,4-dioxane degradation product 2HEAA but that strain ENV478 may nonetheless be useful as a biocatalyst for remediating 1,4-dioxane-contaminated aquifers.},

abstract = {Background: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing reveals the potential in microbial communities. However, lower-cost 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing provides taxonomic, not functional, observations. To remedy this, we previously introduced Piphillin, a software package that predicts functional metagenomic content based on the frequency of detected 16S rRNA gene sequences corresponding to genomes in regularly updated, functionally annotated genome databases. Piphillin (and similar tools) have previously been evaluated on 16S rRNA data processed by the clustering of sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). New techniques such as amplicon sequence variant error correction are in increased use, but it is unknown if these techniques perform better in metagenomic content prediction pipelines, or if they should be treated the same as OTU data in respect to optimal pipeline parameters. Results: To evaluate the effect of 16S rRNA sequence analysis method (clustering sequences into OTUs vs amplicon sequence variant error correction into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)) on the ability of Piphillin to predict functional metagenomic content, we evaluated Piphillin-predicted functional content from 16S rRNA sequence data processed through OTU clustering and error correction into ASVs compared to corresponding shotgun metagenomic data. We show a strong correlation between metagenomic data and Piphillin-predicted functional content resulting from both 16S rRNA sequence analysis methods. Differential abundance testing with Piphillin-predicted functional content exhibited a low false positive rate ({\textless} 0.05) while capturing a large fraction of the differentially abundant features resulting from corresponding metagenomic data. However, Piphillin prediction performance was optimal at different cutoff parameters depending on 16S rRNA sequence analysis method. Using data analyzed with amplicon sequence variant error correction, Piphillin outperformed comparable tools, for instance exhibiting 19{\%} greater balanced accuracy and 54{\%} greater precision compared to PICRUSt2. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that raw Illumina sequences should be processed for subsequent Piphillin analysis using amplicon sequence variant error correction (with DADA2 or similar methods) and run using a 99{\%} ID cutoff for Piphillin, while sequences generated on platforms other than Illumina should be processed via OTU clustering (e.g., UPARSE) and run using a 96{\%} ID cutoff for Piphillin. Piphillin is publicly available for academic users (Piphillin server. http://piphillin.secondgenome.com/.)},

abstract = {Microbial community structure is highly sensitive to natural (e.g. drought, temperature, fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. heavy metal exposure, land-use change) stressors. However, despite an immense amount of data generated, systematic, cross-environment analyses of microbiome responses to multiple disturbances are lacking. Here, we present the Microbiome Stress Project, an open-access database of environmental and host-associated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies collected to facilitate cross-study analyses of microbiome responses to stressors. This database will comprise published and unpublished datasets re-processed from the raw sequences into exact sequence variants using our standardized computational pipeline. Our database will provide insight into general response patterns of microbiome diversity, structure, and stability to environmental stressors. It will also enable the identification of cross-study associations between single or multiple stressors and specific microbial clades. Here, we present a proof-of-concept meta-analysis of 606 microbiomes (from nine studies) to assess microbial community responses to: (1) one stressor in one environment: soil warming across a variety of soil types, (2) a range of stressors in one environment: soil microbiome responses to a comprehensive set of stressors (incl. temperature, diesel, antibiotics, land use change, drought, and heavy metals), (3) one stressor across a range of environments: copper exposure effects on soil, sediment, activated-sludge reactors, and gut environments, and (4) the general trends of microbiome stressor responses. Overall, we found that stressor exposure significantly decreases microbiome alpha diversity and increases beta diversity (community dispersion) across a range of environments and stressor types. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between microbial community resistance to stressors (i.e. the average pairwise similarity score between the control and stressed communities) and alpha diversity. We used Phylofactor to identify microbial clades and individual taxa as potential bioindicators of copper contamination across different environments. Using standardized computational and statistical methods, the Microbiome Stress Project will leverage thousands of existing datasets to build a general framework for how microbial communities respond to environmental stress.},

abstract = {Ribosomal DNA variation was used to study evolutionary relationships among five fungal-like protoctistan Phytophthora species. On the basis of morphological and ecological characteristics, four of these species--P. palmivora, P. megakarya, P. capsici, and P. citrophthora--were once thought to be related. Variation within a species was extensively studied in a fifth, outgroup species--P. cinnamomi--known, on the basis of ecological, isozyme, and mitochondrial DNA studies, to be variable. Internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS I, between the 18S and 5.8S rDNAs; and ITS II, between the 5.8S and 25S rDNAs) from 27 isolates of these five species were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. Intraspecific variability was undetected or low. Interspecific nucleotide difference was 0.3{\%}-14.6{\%}, and comparisons of variable regions permitted the evaluation of phylogenetic relationships among species. Both neighbor-joining and parsimony analysis of ITS variability support a close relationship between cacao isolates of P. capsici and P. citrophthora and a common lineage for P. palmivora and P. megakarya. Large distance values were estimated between P. cinnamomi and the other species. Inferred relationships based on ITS variability were compared with those based on other characters. The catalog of sequences provides the information necessary to design taxon-specific probes potentially useful in taxonomic, ecological, and population-level studies.},

abstract = {Currently, there are large areas of soils contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers which are included in the group of persistent organic pollutants. For the bioremediation of such soils, a new HCH-degrading Rhodococcus wratislaviensis strain Ch628 was isolated from long-term organochlorine contaminated soils. The strain Ch628 was able to degrade 32.3{\%} gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH/lindane), 25.2{\%} hexachlorobenzene, and 100{\%} chlorobenzene in resting cell conditions. The strain Ch628 was bioaugmented in chronically HCH-contaminated soil. The results showed that the bioaugmentation of contaminated soil with the strain Ch628 led to HCH degradation. In the bioaugmented system, the efficiency of HCH removal at the initial concentration of about 238.7 +/- 4.9 mg kg(-1) soil was 44.8{\%}, while the system with indigenous microflora (without R. wratislaviensis strain Ch628) and the system with abiotic control removed 33.3 and 16.4{\%} of this compound during the same period, respectively. Strain Ch628 could effectively degrade alpha-, beta-, and gamma-isomers of HCH (77.1, 100, and 100{\%}, respectively) and heptachlorocyclohexane (69.9{\%}) in the model soil systems. Moreover, the bioaugmentation with the strain Ch628 led to degradation of tri-, tetra-, and penta-chlorobenzenes, which are of HCH degradation metabolites. For the first time, it was found that the bioaugmentation with the bacterial strain Rhodococcus wratislaviensis gamma-h628 led to a significant reduction of the toxicity of the HCHcontaminated soil for the test organisms, such as Chlorella vulgaris Beijer and Daphnia magna Straus.},

abstract = {Background:The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.Results:Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.Conclusions:The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor. {\textcopyright} 2013 McMurdie, Holmes.},

In this paper we argue why standard transformations for compositional data are not suitable for computing correlations, and why the use of raw or log-transformed data is neither meaningful. As a solution, a procedure based on balances is outlined, leading to sensible correlation measures. The construction of the balances is demonstrated using a real data example from geochemistry. It is shown that the considered correlation measures are invariant with respect to the choice of the binary partitions forming the balances. Robust counterparts to the classical, non-robust correlation measures are introduced and applied. By using appropriate graphical representations, it is shown how the resulting correlation coefficients can be interpreted. {\textcopyright} International Association for Mathematical Geosciences 2009.},

abstract = {Microalgae (MA) and purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) have the ability to remove and recover nutrients from digestate (anaerobic digestion effluent) and pre-settled pig manure that can be Utilized as bio-fertilizer and organic fertilizer. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of MA and PPB as organic fertilizers and soil conditioners in relation to plant growth and the soil biological processes involved in nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycling. To this end, a glasshouse experiment was conducted using MA and PPB as bio-fertilizers to grow a common pasture ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) with two destructive harvests (45 and 60 days after emergence). To evaluate the rhizosphere bacterial community, we used barcoded PCR-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes for paired-end sequencing on the Illumina Mi-Seq. Additionally, we used phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis for the detection of putative functional genes associated with N and soil-C cycling. There was a significant increase in plant growth when the soil was amended with PPB, which almost performed as well as the chemical fertilizers. Analysis of the rhizosphere bacteria after the second harvest revealed a greater abundance of Firmicutes than in the first harvest. Members of this phylum have been identified as a biostimulant for plant growth. In contrast, the MA released nutrients more slowly and had a profound effect on N cycling by modulating N mineralization and N retention pathways. Thus, MA could be developed as a slow-release fertilizer with better N retention, which could improve crop performance and soil function, despite nutrient losses from leaching, runoff, and atmospheric emissions. These data indicate that biologically recovered nutrients from waste resources can be effective as a fertilizer, resulting in enhanced C- and N-cycling capacities in the rhizosphere.},

abstract = {Reforestation of agricultural lands with mixed-species environmental plantings can effectively sequester C. While accurate and efficient methods for predicting soil organic C content and composition have recently been developed for soils under agricultural land uses, such methods under forested land uses are currently lacking. This study aimed to develop a method using infrared spectroscopy for accurately predicting total organic C (TOC) and its fractions (particulate, POC; humus, HOC; and resistant, ROC organic C) in soils under environmental plantings. Soils were collected from 117 paired agricultural-reforestation sites across Australia. TOC fractions were determined in a subset of 38 reforested soils using physical fractionation by automated wet-sieving and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Mid- and near-infrared spectra (MNIRS, 6000–450 cm −1 ) were acquired from finely-ground soils from environmental plantings and agricultural land. Satisfactory prediction models based on MNIRS and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were developed for TOC and its fractions. Leave-one-out cross-validations of MNIRS-PLSR models indicated accurate predictions (R 2 {\textgreater} 0.90, negligible bias, ratio of performance to deviation {\textgreater} 3) and fraction-specific functional group contributions to beta coefficients in the models. TOC and its fractions were predicted using the cross-validated models and soil spectra for 3109 reforested and agricultural soils. The reliability of predictions determined using k-nearest neighbour score distance indicated that {\textgreater}80{\%} of predictions were within the satisfactory inlier limit. The study demonstrated the utility of infrared spectroscopy (MNIRS-PLSR) to rapidly and economically determine TOC and its fractions and thereby accurately describe the effects of land use change such as reforestation on agricultural soils.},

abstract = {The effects of long-term agricultural management on active soil organic matter (SOM) and short-term microbial C and N dynamics were investigated. Short-term changes in chemical and biological variables after incorporating fresh rye shoots were measured in intact soil cylinders from three contrasting agricultural systems. Two of the soils were from organic or conventional 4-yr rotations which had been in place for 6 yr as part of the University of California at Davis Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) project and the third was from a double-cropped, intensive vegetable production system in the Salinas Valley of California. Microbial biomass (MB) and respiration, numbers of organisms in several trophic groups, soil inorganic N, dissolved organic C and recoverable rye were measured before and during the 6 weeks following rye incorporation. Active soil organic matter, expressed as the ratios of microbial biomass C or N to total soil C or N, respectively, appeared to be related to long-term management. These ratios increased in proportion to increased organic inputs and reduced tillage or periods of fallow. In all soils, MBC increased and decreased rapidly following rye incorporation, but MBN was fairly constant. Significant differences among the soils in MBC and MBN were maintained over the 6 week experiment. Following rye incorporation, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) active counts of bacteria and bacterial-feeding nematodes increased rapidly, whereas changes in FDA active fungal hyphal lengths and fungal-feeding nematodes were less pronounced. The rates of rye decomposition, respiration and net N mineralization were highest the first week after incorporation, coincident with increases in MBC and numbers of active bacteria in all three soils. There were significant differences among soils in numbers of organisms in the trophic groups on some sample dates, but changes in soil respiration and inorganic N and the rate of rye decomposition remained similar in all three soils. The SAFS organic soil had a somewhat lower ratio of bacterial to fungal biomass and lower ratio of respiration to MBC throughout the experiment than the SAFS conventional soil. Despite long-term differences in agricultural management and differences in active SOM contents among the three soils, the rates of rye decomposition and C and N mineralization were similar. Rye incorporation produced a short-term burst of microbial growth and activity of similar magnitude in all three soils although the initial MB contents in the three soils were different. Variations among the soils in FDA active counts of fungi and numbers of bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes indicated that microbial community composition was more responsive to rye incorporation than were changes in soil C and N pools.},

abstract = {We report that humins extracted as the solid fractions from paddy soils or sediment are involved in extracellular electron transfer, coupled with microbial reductive dehalogenation of pentachlorophenol (PCP), by serving as both electron acceptor and electron donor. In our system, humin is requisite for the dechlorination of PCP, and this activity cannot be maintained when humin is replaced with soluble humic substances or related compounds, including 0.1 M NaOH-extracted humic acid from soil, Aldrich humic acid, and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. The function of humins is stable against treatments with H 2O 2 (30{\%}, 30 min), HCl (0.1 M, 48 h), NH 2OH{\textperiodcentered}HCl (0.1 M, 48 h), NaBH 4 (0.1 M, 15 h), and heat (121 °C, 30 min). Cyclic voltammograms indicated that humin harbors redox-active moieties, and electron spin resonance suggested that quinone moieties within humin are the redox-active centers. Fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses verified the presence of the aryl carbonyl carbon group in humin. Although the proportion of redox-active carbon is very small, the potential electron-mediating ability is not negligible. The finding that humin, in solid form, is redox active has important implications for in situ bioremediation, given the wide distribution of humin and the diversity and ubiquity of humic substance-utilizing microorganisms.

abstract = {Background: No microbe exists in isolation, and few live in environments with only members of their own kingdom or domain. As microbiome studies become increasingly more interested in the interactions between microbes than in cataloging which microbes are present, the variety of microbes in the community should be considered. However, the majority of ecological interaction networks for microbiomes built to date have included only bacteria. Joint association inference across multiple domains of life, e.g., fungal communities (the mycobiome) and bacterial communities, has remained largely elusive. Results: Here, we present a novel extension of the SParse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological ASsociation Inference (SPIEC-EASI) framework that allows statistical inference of cross-domain associations from targeted amplicon sequencing data. For human lung and skin micro- and mycobiomes, we show that cross-domain networks exhibit higher connectivity, increased network stability, and similar topological re-organization patterns compared to single-domain networks. We also validate in vitro a small number of cross-domain interactions predicted by the skin association network. Conclusions: For the human lung and skin micro- and mycobiomes, our findings suggest that fungi play a stabilizing role in ecological network organization. Our study suggests that computational efforts to infer association networks that include all forms of microbial life, paired with large-scale culture-based association validation experiments, will help formulate concrete hypotheses about the underlying biological mechanisms of species interactions and, ultimately, help understand microbial communities as a whole.},

abstract = {Bare fallow soils that have been deprived of fresh carbon inputs for prolonged periods contain mostly old, stable organic carbon. In order to shed light on the nature of this carbon, the functional diversity profiles (MicroResp™, Biolog™ and enzyme activity spectra) of the microbial communities of long-term bare-fallow soils were analysed and compared with those of the microbial communities from their cultivated counterparts. It was assumed that the catabolic and enzymatic profiles would reflect the type of substrates available to the microbial communities. The catabolic profiles suggested that the microbial communities in the long-term bare-fallow soil were exposed to a less diverse range of substrates and that these substrates tended to be of simpler molecular forms. Both the catabolic and enzyme activity profiles suggested that the microbial communities from the long-term bare-fallow soils were less adapted to using polymers. These results do not fit with the traditional view of old, stable carbon being composed of complex, recalcitrant polymers. Microbial communities from the long-term bare fallow soils tended to preferentially use substrates with higher nominal oxidation states of carbon relative to the substrates used by the microbial communities from the cultivated soils. This suggests that the microbial communities from the long-term bare-fallow soils were better adapted to using readily oxidizable, although energetically less rewarding, substrates. Microbial communities appear to adapt to the deprivation of fresh organic matter by using substrates that require little investment, such as enzyme production.},

abstract = {Background. Rieske non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs) are multi-component enzyme systems that are remarkably diverse in bacteria isolated from diverse habitats. Since the first classification in 1990, there has been a need to devise a new classification scheme for these enzymes because many RHOs have been discovered, which do not belong to any group in the previous classification. Here, we present a scheme for classification of RHOs reflecting new sequence information and interactions between RHO enzyme components. Result. We have analyzed a total of 130 RHO enzymes in which 25 well-characterized RHO enzymes were used as standards to test our hypothesis for the proposed classification system. From the sequence analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) components of the standard RHOs, we extracted classification keys that reflect not only the phylogenetic affiliation within each component but also relationship among components. Oxygenase components of standard RHOs were phylogenetically classified into 10 groups with the classification keys derived from ETC components. This phylogenetic classification scheme was converted to a new systematic classification consisting of 5 distinct types. The new classification system was statistically examined to justify its stability. Type I represents two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an FNRC-type reductase. Type II contains other two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an FNRN-type reductase. Type III represents a group of three-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase. Type IV represents another three-component systems that consist of oxygenase, [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and GR-type reductase. Type V represents another different three-component systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase. Conclusion. The new classification system provides the following features. First, the new classification system analyzes RHO enzymes as a whole. RwithSecond, the new classification system is not static but responds dynamically to the growing pool of RHO enzymes. Third, our classification can be applied reliably to the classification of incomplete RHOs. Fourth, the classification has direct applicability to experimental work. Fifth, the system provides new insights into the evolution of RHO systems based on enzyme interaction. {\textcopyright} 2008 Kweon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Sugars are the most abundant organic compounds in the biosphere because they are monomers of all polysaccharides. We summarize the results of the last 40 years on the sources, content, composition and fate of sugars in soil and discuss their main functions. We especially focus on sugar uptake, utilization and recycling by microorganisms as this is by far the dominating process of sugar transformation in soil compared to sorption, leaching or plant uptake. Moreover, sugars are the most important carbon (C) and energy source for soil microorganisms.Two databases have been created. The 1st database focused on the contents of cellulose, non-cellulose, hot-water and cold-water extractable sugars in soils (348 data, 32 studies). This enabled determining the primary (plant-derived) and secondary (microbially and soil organic matter (SOM) derived) sources of carbohydrates in soil based on the galactose + mannose/arabinose + xylose (GM/AX) ratio. The 2nd database focused on the fate of sugar C in soils (734 data pairs, 32 studies using 13C or 14C labeled sugars). 13C and 14C dynamics enabled calculating the: 1) initial rate of sugar mineralization, 2) mean residence time (MRT) of C of the applied sugars, and 3) MRT of sugar C incorporated into 3a) microbial biomass and 3b) SOM.The content of hexoses was 3-4 times higher than pentoses, because hexoses originate from plants and microorganisms. The GM/AX ratio of non-cellulose sugars revealed a lower contribution of hexoses in cropland and grassland (ratio 0.7-1) compare to forest (ratio 1.5) soils.13C and 14C studies showed very high initial rate of glucose mineralization (1.1{\%} min-1) and much higher rate of sugars uptake by microorganisms from the soil solution. Considering this rate along with the glucose input from plants and its content in soil solution, we estimate that only about 20{\%} of all sugars in soil originate from the primary source - decomposition of plant litter and rhizodeposits. The remaining 80{\%} originates from the secondary source - microorganisms and their residues. The estimated MRT of sugar C in microbial biomass was about 230 days, showing intense and efficient internal recycling within microorganisms. The assessed MRT of sugar C in SOM was about 360 days, reflecting the considerable accumulation of sugar C in microbial residues and its comparatively slow external recycling.The very rapid uptake of sugars by microorganisms and intensive recycling clearly demonstrate the importance of sugars for microbes in soil. We speculate that the most important functions of sugars in soil are to maintain and stimulate microbial activities in the rhizosphere and detritusphere leading to mobilization of nutrients by accelerated SOM decomposition - priming effects. We conclude that the actual contribution of sugar C (not only whole sugar molecules, which are usually determined) to SOM is much higher than the 10 ± 5{\%} commonly measured based on their content.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO2. Their growth depends on the carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C:N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2012 New Phytologist Trust.},

Therefore, we developed a method to introduce the degrading-bacterial consortium into contaminated soil using a special charcoal material that enriched the soil with a methylthio-s-triazine degrading bacterium and the chloro-s-triazine degrading bacterial consortium CD7. For in situ bioremediation study, the enriched charcoal with CD7 was used at a contaminated site with simazine.

Seven DDT degradation intermediates (metabolites) were detected and identified in PYR2-augmented soils: five by GC/MS: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDMS), and dichlorobenzophenone (DBP); and two by LC/MS: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA) and 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA). Levels of metabolites were fairly stable in control soils but varied greatly with time in PYR2-augmented soils. Levels of DDD, DDMU, and DDE in PYR2-augmented soils increased from day 0 to day 30 and then decreased by day 45. A DDT biodegradation pathway is proposed based on our identification of DDT metabolites in PYR2-augmented systems. PYR2 will be useful in future studies of OCP biodegradation and in bioremediation of OCP-contaminated soils.},

abstract = {The mineralogy of the clay fraction of soils is a major determinant of the behavior of soil. Conventionally these clay minerals have been determined using techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), but new complementary methods such as infrared spectroscopy can be used to rapidly and economically predict these minerals. This paper presents a methodology to predict these clay minerals at high-resolution that adhere to GlobalSoilMap (GSM) standards. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic models were formulated for clay minerals kaolinite, illite and smectite using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and legacy quantitative XRD determinations. Very strong models were achieved for kaolinite, illite and smectite and the root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) were all {\textless} 12 wt.{\%}. Spectroscopic models were applied to 11,500 samples from western Victoria and harmonized to the GSM specified depth intervals using equal area splines. Clay minerals were then mapped using data mining model trees with a 10-fold cross validation to derive a mean prediction estimate and 90{\%} prediction interval. Spatial models accounted for 26 to 77{\%} of the total variation with kaolinite predictions for all 6 GSM depths ≥ 65{\%}. Kaolinite is the dominant soil clay mineral of western Victoria for uplands and weathered volcanic terrains. Illite concentrations are higher where associated with weathered granitic plutons and in aeolian deposits of semi-arid environments. Smectite tends to occur associated with depressions of plains (volcanic and sedimentary). Further supplementation of additional sites and samples for landscapes with relatively sparse observations should contribute to refined and improved maps of these clay minerals.},

Residual fractions of these pesticides persisted till the end of the 16-week experiment. DDT was degraded through 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD). Accumulation of this product corresponded stoichiometrically only to 34-53{\%} of removed DDT, supposedly due to its further transformations, finally resulting in formation of detected 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DBP). Addition of 0.5 mM Tween 80 nonionic surfactant resulted in about a twofold decrease of gamma -HCH and methoxychlor residual concentrations, as well as considerably lower DDD accumulation (7-29{\%}) and higher DBP production. However, 1.25 mM dose of this surfactant applied together with granular sludge brought DDD levels back to that observed for treatments with the sludge alone, also impairing DBP formation.},

However, biotic factors are rarely factored into agricultural management models. Today it is possible to identify specific microbiomes and define biotic components that contribute to soil quality. We assessed the bacterial diversity of soils in 51 potato production plots. We describe a strategy for identifying a potato-crop-productivity bacterial species balance index based on amplicon sequence variants. We observed a significant impact of soil texture balances on potato yields; however, the Shannon and Chao1 richness indices and Pielou's evenness index poorly correlated with these yields. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate the portion of the total bacterial microbiome related to potato yield using an integrated species balances index derived from the elements of the bacterial microbiome that positively or negatively correlate with residual potato yields. This innovative strategy based on a microbiome selection procedure greatly enhances our ability to interpret the impact of agricultural practices and cropping system management choices on microbial diversity and potato yield. This strategy provides an additional tool that will aid growers and the broader agricultural sector in their decision-making processes concerning the soil quality and crop productivity.},

abstract = {We report that humins extracted as the solid fractions from paddy soils or sediment are involved in extracellular electron transfer, coupled with microbial reductive dehalogenation of pentachlorophenol (PCP), by serving as both electron acceptor and electron donor. In our system, humin is requisite for the dechlorination of PCP, and this activity cannot be maintained when humin is replaced with soluble humic substances or related compounds, including 0.1 M NaOH-extracted humic acid from soil, Aldrich humic acid, and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. The function of humins is stable against treatments with H 2O 2 (30{\%}, 30 min), HCl (0.1 M, 48 h), NH 2OH{\textperiodcentered}HCl (0.1 M, 48 h), NaBH 4 (0.1 M, 15 h), and heat (121 °C, 30 min). Cyclic voltammograms indicated that humin harbors redox-active moieties, and electron spin resonance suggested that quinone moieties within humin are the redox-active centers. Fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses verified the presence of the aryl carbonyl carbon group in humin. Although the proportion of redox-active carbon is very small, the potential electron-mediating ability is not negligible. The finding that humin, in solid form, is redox active has important implications for in situ bioremediation, given the wide distribution of humin and the diversity and ubiquity of humic substance-utilizing microorganisms.

In this work, we have developed and implemented a set of synthetic 16S rRNA genes to serve as uni-versal spike-in standards for 16S-seq experiments. The spike-ins represent full-length 16S rRNA genes containing artificial variable regions with negligible identity to known nucleotide sequences, permitting unambiguous identification of spike-in sequences in 16S-seq read data from any microbiome sample. Using defined mock communities and environmen-tal microbiota, we characterized the performance of the spike-in standards and demonstrated their util-ity for evaluating data quality on a per-sample ba-sis. Further, we showed that staggered spike-in mix-tures added at the point of DNA extraction enable concurrent estimation of absolute microbial abun-dances suitable for comparative analysis. Results also underscored that template-specific Illumina se-quencing artifacts may lead to biases in the per-ceived abundance of certain taxa. Taken together, the spike-in standards represent a novel bioana-lytical tool that can substantially improve 16S-seq-based microbiome studies by enabling comprehen-sive quality control along with absolute quantifica-tion.},

The depuration, accumulation, and translocation of DP in rice plants were observed. The contributions of plant uptake, microbial degradation, and bound-residue formation to DP dissipation under the rhizosphere effect were modeled and quantified. The gradients of DP concentrations correlated well with microbial biomass in the rhizosphere (R2 = 0.898). The rhizosphere facilitated the bioavailability of DP (excitation) and modified the bound-residue formation of DP (aging). DP concentrations in roots were positively correlated with the labile fraction of DP in soil (R2 = 0.852–0.961). There were spatiotemporal variations in the DP fractions. Dissolved and soil organic carbon were important influences on fraction transformation. Contributions to total DP dissipation were in the following ranges: microbial degradation (8.33–54.14{\%}), bound-residue formation (3.64–16.43{\%}), and plant uptake (0.54–3.85{\%}). With all of these processes operating, the half-life of DP in the rhizosphere was 105 days. The stereoselectivity of DP isomers in both rice and DP fractions in soil were observed, suggesting a link between stereoselective bioaccumulation of DP in terrestrial organisms and dissipation pathways in soil.},

This is possible by means of new/improved microbial species. The behavior of isolated strains and the microorganisms when present in community is altogether different. Therefore, there is a need to develop new technology which will identify the minor component of the microbial community involved in degradation because the minor part might have profound effect on degradation.

abstract = {Traditional models of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition are all based on first order kinetics in which the decomposition rate of a particular C pool is proportional to the size of the pool and a simple decomposition constant (dC/dt = kC). In fact, SOM decomposition is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes that are produced by microorganisms. We built a simple theoretical model to explore the behavior of the decomposition-microbial growth system when the fundamental kinetic assumption is changed from first order kinetics to exoenzymes catalyzed decomposition (dC/dt = KC x Enzymes). An analysis of the enzyme kinetics showed that there must be some mechanism to produce a non-linear response of decomposition rates to enzyme concentration - the most likely is competition for enzyme binding on solid substrates as predicted by Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory. This non-linearity also induces C limitation, regardless of the potential supply of C. The linked C and N version of the model showed that actual polymer breakdown and microbial use of the released monomers can be disconnected, and that it requires relatively little N to maintain the maximal rate of decomposition, regardless of the microbial biomass' ability to use the breakdown products. In this model, adding a pulse of C to an N limited system increases respiration, while adding N actually decreases respiration (as C is redirected from waste respiration to microbial growth). For many years, researchers have argued that the lack of a respiratory response by soil microbes to added N indicates that they are not N limited. This model suggests that conclusion may be wrong. While total C flow may be limited by the functioning of the exoenzyme system, actual microbial growth may be N limited. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sugars are the most abundant organic compounds in the biosphere because they are monomers of all polysaccharides. We summarize the results of the last 40 years on the sources, content, composition and fate of sugars in soil and discuss their main functions. We especially focus on sugar uptake, utilization and recycling by microorganisms as this is by far the dominating process of sugar transformation in soil compared to sorption, leaching or plant uptake. Moreover, sugars are the most important carbon (C) and energy source for soil microorganisms.Two databases have been created. The 1st database focused on the contents of cellulose, non-cellulose, hot-water and cold-water extractable sugars in soils (348 data, 32 studies). This enabled determining the primary (plant-derived) and secondary (microbially and soil organic matter (SOM) derived) sources of carbohydrates in soil based on the galactose + mannose/arabinose + xylose (GM/AX) ratio. The 2nd database focused on the fate of sugar C in soils (734 data pairs, 32 studies using 13C or 14C labeled sugars). 13C and 14C dynamics enabled calculating the: 1) initial rate of sugar mineralization, 2) mean residence time (MRT) of C of the applied sugars, and 3) MRT of sugar C incorporated into 3a) microbial biomass and 3b) SOM.The content of hexoses was 3-4 times higher than pentoses, because hexoses originate from plants and microorganisms. The GM/AX ratio of non-cellulose sugars revealed a lower contribution of hexoses in cropland and grassland (ratio 0.7-1) compare to forest (ratio 1.5) soils.13C and 14C studies showed very high initial rate of glucose mineralization (1.1{\%} min-1) and much higher rate of sugars uptake by microorganisms from the soil solution. Considering this rate along with the glucose input from plants and its content in soil solution, we estimate that only about 20{\%} of all sugars in soil originate from the primary source - decomposition of plant litter and rhizodeposits. The remaining 80{\%} originates from the secondary source - microorganisms and their residues. The estimated MRT of sugar C in microbial biomass was about 230 days, showing intense and efficient internal recycling within microorganisms. The assessed MRT of sugar C in SOM was about 360 days, reflecting the considerable accumulation of sugar C in microbial residues and its comparatively slow external recycling.The very rapid uptake of sugars by microorganisms and intensive recycling clearly demonstrate the importance of sugars for microbes in soil. We speculate that the most important functions of sugars in soil are to maintain and stimulate microbial activities in the rhizosphere and detritusphere leading to mobilization of nutrients by accelerated SOM decomposition - priming effects. We conclude that the actual contribution of sugar C (not only whole sugar molecules, which are usually determined) to SOM is much higher than the 10 ± 5{\%} commonly measured based on their content.},

abstract = {In spite of several quality control procedures used by Australia to ensure the wholesomeness of export meat, a number of pesticide residue violations were identified in the Australian product exported to the USA in May 1987. The pesticides involved were the organochlorines, dieldrin and heptachlor. The problems were caused by the persistence of organochlorines in soils and their illicit use or contamination of storage facilities. Animals grazing contaminated pasture, ingesting contaminated feed or held in contaminated yards over a period, bioaccumulated residues in their adipose tissues which eventually exceeded maximum residue limits (MRL) and caused violations. Though there was no immediate public health risk, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE), acted expeditiously to determine and eliminate the factors causing these problems, which threatened Australia's beef export industry worth in excess of two billion dollars annually. An overall strategic plan, "The Integrated Action Plan", was formulated and implemented by AQIS with the assistance of the relevant Departments of the States and the Northern Territory (NT), meat processing and export industries and livestock producer bodies. As a result of this action, the likely sources of contamination were identified and controlled. The National Residue Survey (NRS) was enhanced, a National Residue Data Base (NRDB) was established and a centralised computer system interactive with abattoirs, laboratories and animal health authorities developed. The cattle farm identity tail tag system already in place, capable of tracing cattle to the farm of origin was refined and trace back systems for sheep and pigs were utilised.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Protecting biological diversity with limited resources may require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Cometabolism recognizes that microorganisms can transform non-growth-supporting substrates. The term "cometabolism" was first introduced over 30 years ago and has been redefined, criticized, and used widely ever since. In this review we have examined the aerobic cometabolism of chlorinated solvents, with a particular emphasis on the cometabolism of trichloroethylene. Monooxygenases or dioxygenases with relaxed substrate ranges initiate these transformations. The physiological role of the oxygenases is to initiate the metabolism of growth-supporting substrates (e.g., methane, propane, butane, toluene, ethylene, and ammonia). Diverse enzymes catalyze these oxidative reactions with chlorinated solvents. Synthesis of most of these enzymes is induced by the presence of the growth-supporting substrate and is largely regulated at the level of gene transcription. The genes that code for a given oxygenase are usually clustered together in a single operon and often share homology with counterparts that code for the subunits of related oxygenases in other bacteria. During cometabolism the growth-supporting and non-growth-supporting substrates can both bind to the oxygenase. Transformation of chlorinated solvents by these enzymes presents the cell with a new set of compounds. Some of these compounds are toxic to the cells, others are stable products that are expelled from the cell, and in a few cases the cells utilize the products. The combined effects of cometabolism can have a profound influence on a cell.},

abstract = {Long term residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soils are of great concerning because they seriously threaten food security and human health. This article focuses on isolation of OCP-degrading strains and their performance in bioremediation of contaminated soil under ex situ conditions. A bacterium, Chryseobacterium sp. PYR2, capable of degrading various OCPs and utilizing them as a sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from OCP-contaminated soil. In culture experiments, PYR2 degraded 80-98{\%} of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) or 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) isomers (50 mg L-1) in 30 days. A pilot-scale ex situ bioremediation study of highly OCP-contaminated soil augmented with PYR2 was performed. During the 45-day experimental period, DDT concentration was reduced by 80.3{\%} in PYR2-augmented soils (35.37 mg kg-1 to 6.97 mg kg-1) but by only 57.6{\%} in control soils. Seven DDT degradation intermediates (metabolites) were detected and identified in PYR2-augmented soils: five by GC/MS: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDMS), and dichlorobenzophenone (DBP); and two by LC/MS: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA) and 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA). Levels of metabolites were fairly stable in control soils but varied greatly with time in PYR2-augmented soils. Levels of DDD, DDMU, and DDE in PYR2-augmented soils increased from day 0 to day 30 and then decreased by day 45. A DDT biodegradation pathway is proposed based on our identification of DDT metabolites in PYR2-augmented systems. PYR2 will be useful in future studies of OCP biodegradation and in bioremediation of OCP-contaminated soils.},

abstract = {The fractions transformation and dissipation mechanism of Dechlorane Plus (DP) in the rhizosphere of soil–plant system were investigated and characterized by a 150-day experiment using a rhizobox system. The depuration, accumulation, and translocation of DP in rice plants were observed. The contributions of plant uptake, microbial degradation, and bound-residue formation to DP dissipation under the rhizosphere effect were modeled and quantified. The gradients of DP concentrations correlated well with microbial biomass in the rhizosphere (R2 = 0.898). The rhizosphere facilitated the bioavailability of DP (excitation) and modified the bound-residue formation of DP (aging). DP concentrations in roots were positively correlated with the labile fraction of DP in soil (R2 = 0.852–0.961). There were spatiotemporal variations in the DP fractions. Dissolved and soil organic carbon were important influences on fraction transformation. Contributions to total DP dissipation were in the following ranges: microbial degradation (8.33–54.14{\%}), bound-residue formation (3.64–16.43{\%}), and plant uptake (0.54–3.85{\%}). With all of these processes operating, the half-life of DP in the rhizosphere was 105 days. The stereoselectivity of DP isomers in both rice and DP fractions in soil were observed, suggesting a link between stereoselective bioaccumulation of DP in terrestrial organisms and dissipation pathways in soil.},

abstract = {Due to differences in mineralogical composition and organic matter density, soil particle size fractions (PSF) provide different surface properties and micro-environments, which may affect the adsorption of chemicals and select for distinct microbial communities. Using soils from a long-term fertilisation experiment, we examined the structural diversity of microbial communities associated with different PSF and their potential to mineralise two organic pollutants (phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP)). The soils were taken from 0 to 18 cm depth of arable field plots that have been kept unfertilised (UNF), mineral fertilised (NPK), or treated with animal manure (AM) for 117 years. Sand, including particulate organic matter (POM), coarse silt, fine silt, and clay were isolated by gentle ultra-sonication, wet-sieving and centrifugation. Animal manuring increased the abundance of the three microbial domains Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi, with coarse silt being most responsive. The impact of manuring declined with decreasing particle size. Genetic profiling indicated that the composition of the bacterial communities was primarily shaped by soil particle size classes, while archaea responded predominantly to fertilisation. Particle size as well as fertilisation was equally important in structuring the fungal communities. All PSF showed capacity for phenol mineralisation with rates correlating negatively with particle size (except for the sand-POM fraction), and long-term fertilisation enhanced the mineralisation potential. In contrast, DCP mineralisation was associated with the clay fraction only and was highest for soil treated with mineral fertiliser. This study demonstrates that PSF harbour structurally distinct microbial communities with different functional potentials for mineralising organic pollutants.},

Apart from human enzymes, recent studies have indicated the role of the gut bacterial community (microbiome) in metabolizing xenobiotics. However, little is known about the contribution of the plethora of gut microbiome in xenobiotic metabolism. The present study reports the results of analyses on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in various human gut microbiomes. A total of 397 available gut metagenomes from individuals of varying age groups from 8 nationalities were analyzed. Based on the diversities and abundances of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, various bacterial taxa were classified into three groups, namely, least versatile, intermediately versatile and highly versatile xenobiotic metabolizers. Most interestingly, specific relationships were observed between the overall drug consumption profile and the abundance and diversity of the xenobiotic metabolizing repertoire in various geographies. The obtained differential abundance patterns of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and bacterial genera harboring them, suggest their links to pharmacokinetic variations among individuals. Additional analyses of a few well studied classes of drug modifying enzymes (DMEs) also indicate geographic as well as age specific trends.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of selected electron donors and electron acceptors on the anaerobic biodegradation of DDT and its major metabolites in a muck soil with a long history of exposure to the pesticide. Loss of DDT was measured in anaerobic microcosms supplemented with H2, lactate, and acetate. The greatest loss of DDT (approximately 87 {\%}) was observed in microcosms amended with lactate and no additional electron acceptor compared to the no additional electron donor or acceptor sets. An increase in measureable concentrations of DDx was observed in un-amended microcosms. In larger scale mesocosms, significant increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) corresponded with low redox potentials. Increases in DOC corresponded with sharp increases in measured concentrations of DDx, followed by a decrease in measured DDT concentrations in lactate-amended mesocosms. Our studies indicate that sorbed DDx is released upon anaerobic incubation, and that indigenous microorganisms capable of DDx degradation respond to lactate additions. Both the potential for release of sorbed DDx and the potential for biodegradation of DDx should be considered during remediation of DDx-contaminated organic soils at low redox potentials. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO2. Their growth depends on the carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C:N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2012 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) affects soil-plant systems by stimulating plant growth, rhizosphere processes and altering the amount and quality of organic matter inputs. This study examined whether these plant-mediated processes indirectly influence the structure and function of soil microbial communities and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Surface soils (0-5 and 5-10 cm) of Calcarosol, Chromosol and Vertosol were sampled after 5 years' exposure to either ambient CO2 (aCO2; 390 ppm) or eCO2 (550 ppm) using free-air CO2 enrichment (SoilFACE). Changes in microbial community structure were not detected using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analyses (ARISA). However, quantitative PCR of targeted organic C decomposition (cu, cbh), N mineralisation (apr, npr), nitrification (amoB, amoA, norA) and denitrification (nirK, narG, nosZ) genes showed that eCO2 reduced the abundance of half of the functional genes in the Chromosol and Vertosol and their abundance was tightly coupled with total C and N pools. In the Chromosol, total N and C of soil ({\textless}2 mm particles) was reduced by up to 20{\%} and was associated with enhanced microbial activity (soil respiration). Soil C was also reduced in the Vertosol (15{\%}, 5-10 cm); however greater laccase, reduced cellulase and lower microbial activity indicated that organic matter decomposition was currently limited by N. The loss of soil organic N and C under eCO2 was likely driven by greater N demand. This study highlighted that the indirect effects of eCO2 on functional capacity of soil microbial communities in dryland agricultural system depended on the soil type.},

abstract = {There has been and continues to be considerable scientific interest in predicting bioremediation rates and endpoints. This requires the development of chemical techniques capable of reliably predicting the bioavailability of organic compounds to catabolically active soil microbes. A major issue in understanding the link between chemical extraction and bioavailability is the problem of definition; there are numerous definitions, of varying degrees of complexity and relevance, to the interaction between organic contaminants and microorganisms in soil. The aim of this review is to consider the bioavailability as a descriptor for the rate and extent of biodegradation and, in an applied sense, bioremediation of organic contaminants in soil. To address this, the review will (i) consider and clarify the numerous definitions of bioavailability and discuss the usefulness of the term 'bioaccessibility'; (ii) relate definition to the microbiological and chemical measurement of organic contaminants' bioavailability in soil, and (iii) explore the mechanisms employed by soil microorganisms to attack organic contaminants in soil. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Consensus is emerging that microbial materials are an important constituent of stable SOM, and new conceptual and quantitative SOM models are rapidly incorporating this view. However, direct evidence demonstrating that microbial residues account for the chemistry, stability and abundance of SOM is still lacking. Further, emerging models emphasize the stabilization of microbial-derived SOM by abiotic mechanisms, while the effects of microbial physiology on microbial residue production remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct evidence that soil microbes produce chemically diverse, stable SOM. We show that SOM accumulation is driven by distinct microbial communities more so than clay mineralogy, where microbial-derived SOM accumulation is greatest in soils with higher fungal abundances and more efficient microbial biomass production.},

In the presence of 500 mu g of alasan ml(-1), the apparent aqueous solubilities of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were increased 6.6-, 25.7-, and 19.8-fold, respectively. Physicochemical characterization of the solubilization activity suggested that alasan solubilizes PAHs by a physical interaction, most likely of a hydrophobic nature, and that this interaction is slowly reversible. Moreover, the increase in apparent aqueous solubility of PAHs does not depend on the conformation of alasan and is not affected by the formation of multimolecular aggregates of alasan above its saturation concentration. The presence of alasan more than doubled the rate of [C-14]fluoranthene mineralization and significantly increased the rate of [C-14]phenanthrene mineralization by Sphingomonas paucimobilis EPA505. The results suggest that alasan-enhanced solubility of hydrophobic compounds has potential applications in bioremediation.},

The concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) and its metabolites 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE) were monitored during an 8-week remediation process. Physicochemical characterization of the treated soil was performed before and after the bioremediation process. The isolation and identification of predominant microorganisms during the remediation process were also carried out. The efficiency of detoxification was evaluated after each bioremediation protocol. Humidity and pH and the heterotrophic microorganism count were monitored weekly. The DDT concentration was reduced by 79{\%} after 8weeks via biostimulation with surfactant addition (B+S) and 94.3{\%} via biostimulation alone (B). Likewise, the concentrations of the metabolites DDE and DDD were reduced to levels below the quantification limits. The microorganisms isolated during bioremediation were identified as Bacillus thuringiensis, Flavobacterium sp., Cuprivadius sp., Variovorax soli, Phenylobacterium sp. and Lysobacter sp., among others. Analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allowed visualization of the colonization patterns of soil particles. The toxicity of the soil before and after bioremediation was evaluated using Vibrio fischeri as a bioluminescent sensor. A decrease in the toxic potential of the soil was verified by the increase of the concentration/effect relationship EC50 to 26.9{\%} and 27.2{\%} for B+S and B, respectively, compared to 0.4{\%} obtained for the soil before treatment and 2.5{\%} by natural attenuation after 8weeks of treatment.},

abstract = {Humic substances (HS) are an operationally defined fraction of soil organic matter, and they represent the largest pool of recalcitrant organic carbon in the terrestrial environment. It has traditionally been thought that extractable HS consist of novel categories of cross-linked macromolecular structures. In this study, advanced nuclear magnetic resonance approaches were used to study the major components (proteins, carbohydrates, aliphatic biopolymers, and lignin) that are known to be present in HS, and to identify their fingerprints in humic mixtures. Theoretically, once all known components have been identified, the remaining signals should be from materials with novel structures, themselves forming a distinct chemical category of humic materials. Surprisingly, nearly all of the NMR signals in traditional HS fractions could be assigned to intact and degrading biopolymers. We therefore suggest that the vast majority of operationally defined humic material in soils is a very complex mixture of microbial and plant biopolymers and their degradation products but not a distinct chemical category. It is important to note this work in no way rules out the existence of a distinct category of humic macromolecules, either at low abundance in the soluble fraction from young soils, in diagenetically evolved samples (for example lignites, etc.), or in the nonextractable humin fraction. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The application of phylogenetic taxonomic procedures led to improvements in the classification of bacteria assigned to the phylum Actinobacteria but even so there remains a need to further clarify relationships within a taxon that encompasses organisms of agricultural, biotechnological, clinical, and ecological importance. Classification of the morphologically diverse bacteria belonging to this large phylum based on a limited number of features has proved to be difficult, not least when taxonomic decisions rested heavily on interpretation of poorly resolved 16S rRNA gene trees. Here, draft genome sequences of a large collection of actinobacterial type strains were used to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using principles drawn from phylogenetic systematics. The majority of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several orders, families, and genera, as well as many species and a few subspecies were shown to be in need of revision leading to proposals for the recognition of 2 orders, 10 families, and 17 genera, as well as the transfer of over 100 species to other genera. In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving the addition of data on genome size and DNA G+C content, the former can be considered to be a valuable taxonomic marker in actinobacterial systematics. Many of the incongruities detected when the results of the present study were compared with existing classifications had been recognized from 16S rRNA gene trees though whole-genome phylogenies proved to be much better resolved. The few significant incongruities found between 16S/23S rRNA and whole genome trees underline the pitfalls inherent in phylogenies based upon single gene sequences. Similarly good congruence was found between the discontinuous distribution of phenotypic properties and taxa delineated in the phylogenetic trees though diverse non-monophyletic taxa appeared to be based on the use of plesiomorphic character states as diagnostic features.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous soil pollutants. The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. 13C-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in 13C-SIP incubations compared to 12C-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of 13C-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation. Active PHE-degraders act in a consortium, whereby complete PHE mineralization is achieved through the combined activity of taxonomically diverse co-occurring bacteria performing successive metabolic steps. Our study reveals hitherto underestimated functional interactions for full microbial detoxification in contaminated soils.},

abstract = {The betweenness centrality index is essential in the analysis of social networks, but costly to compute. Currently, the fastest known algorithms require $\Theta$(n3) time and $\Theta$(n2) space, where n is the number of actors in the network. Motivated by the fast-growing need to compute centrality indices on large, yet very sparse, networks, new algorithms for betweenness are introduced in this paper. They require script O sign(n + m) space and run in script O sign(nm) and script O sign(nm + n2 log n) time on unweighted and weighted networks, respectively, where m is the number of links. Experimental evidence is provided that this substantially increases the range of networks for which centrality analysis is feasible.},

We report here the primary sequence determination and the analysis of the crystal structure of the 1,2-HQD from Nocardioides simplex 3E solved at 1.75 A resolution using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion of the two catalytic irons (1 Fe/293 amino acids). The catalytic Fe(III) coordination polyhedron composed by the side chains of Tyr164, Tyr197, His221, and His 223 resembles that of the other known intradiol-cleaving dioxygenases, but several of the tertiary structure features are notably different. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the present structure is the extensive openings and consequent exposure to solvent of the upper part of the catalytic cavity arranged to favor the binding of hydroxyquinols but not catechols. A co-crystallized benzoate-like molecule is also found bound to the metal center forming a distinctive hydrogen bond network as observed previously also in 4-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Rhodococcus opacus 1CP. This is the first structure of an intradiol dioxygenase specialized in hydroxyquinol ring cleavage to be investigated in detail. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

However, the impact of biochar on the content and composition of OC has not been comprehensively summarized. This review provided a detailed examination on the stability of biochar and its effect on the amount, composition and turnover of soil OC, with key limitations and issues recognized. The direct input of labile and stable OC of biochar to soil OC pool, and indirect effects of biochar on soil OC by affecting soil physicochemical and biological properties were discussed. Both low stability of biochar and biochar-induced strong positive priming effect on OC mineralization were commonly observed in sandy soil added with biochar produced from manure at low temperature. The stable OC of biochar was composed of both aromatic OC and the OC fractions stabilized by soil minerals. Biochar mainly increased the formation of macro-aggregates, and this promotion was more intense for clayey soil added with manure-based low temperature-biochar. Additionally, potential influential mechanisms were proposed to explain the effect of biochar addition on amount and composition of humic substances in soils. This review will shed lights on the effect of biochar application on the amount, composition and turnover of native soil OC, and improve the understanding of the ecological effect of biochar on the soil functions.},

Apart from human enzymes, recent studies have indicated the role of the gut bacterial community (microbiome) in metabolizing xenobiotics. However, little is known about the contribution of the plethora of gut microbiome in xenobiotic metabolism. The present study reports the results of analyses on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in various human gut microbiomes. A total of 397 available gut metagenomes from individuals of varying age groups from 8 nationalities were analyzed. Based on the diversities and abundances of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, various bacterial taxa were classified into three groups, namely, least versatile, intermediately versatile and highly versatile xenobiotic metabolizers. Most interestingly, specific relationships were observed between the overall drug consumption profile and the abundance and diversity of the xenobiotic metabolizing repertoire in various geographies. The obtained differential abundance patterns of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and bacterial genera harboring them, suggest their links to pharmacokinetic variations among individuals. Additional analyses of a few well studied classes of drug modifying enzymes (DMEs) also indicate geographic as well as age specific trends.},

abstract = {Despite the central role of quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the quantification of mRNA transcripts, most analyses of qPCR data are still delegated to the software that comes with the qPCR apparatus. This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed PCR efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as 'fold-difference' results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the PCR reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the PCR reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible PCR efficiency values. PCR efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in qPCR results was significantly reduced when the mean of these PCR efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.},

This work was done to determine concentrations and enantiomeric ratios of several chiral organochlorine pesticides in soils from the Corn Belt region.

Concentrations were determined for 11 compounds (o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, and trans-nonachlor) in 38 agricultural soils and two garden soils. Residues were log-normally distributed, and geometric mean values (ng/g dry wt) were Sigma DDT = 9.6, Sigma chlordane = 1.4, dieldrin = 1.0, and HEPX = 0.58. HEPT and alpha-HCH were found infrequently. Concentrations in two garden soils were similar to those for agricultural soils. Enantioselective analysis was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with chiral-phase capillary columns. Evidence of enantioselective degradation of OCs was found in 30 soils, o,p'-DDT and OXY showed differing enantiomeric patterns in different soils, while (+)TC, (-)CC, and (-)HEPX were in excess in all soils with nonracemic compositions. The two garden soils showed similar patterns of degradation. No correlations were found between ER and pesticide concentration or ER and {\%} TOC for any of the compounds.},

abstract = {Background: No microbe exists in isolation, and few live in environments with only members of their own kingdom or domain. As microbiome studies become increasingly more interested in the interactions between microbes than in cataloging which microbes are present, the variety of microbes in the community should be considered. However, the majority of ecological interaction networks for microbiomes built to date have included only bacteria. Joint association inference across multiple domains of life, e.g., fungal communities (the mycobiome) and bacterial communities, has remained largely elusive. Results: Here, we present a novel extension of the SParse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological ASsociation Inference (SPIEC-EASI) framework that allows statistical inference of cross-domain associations from targeted amplicon sequencing data. For human lung and skin micro- and mycobiomes, we show that cross-domain networks exhibit higher connectivity, increased network stability, and similar topological re-organization patterns compared to single-domain networks. We also validate in vitro a small number of cross-domain interactions predicted by the skin association network. Conclusions: For the human lung and skin micro- and mycobiomes, our findings suggest that fungi play a stabilizing role in ecological network organization. Our study suggests that computational efforts to infer association networks that include all forms of microbial life, paired with large-scale culture-based association validation experiments, will help formulate concrete hypotheses about the underlying biological mechanisms of species interactions and, ultimately, help understand microbial communities as a whole.},

abstract = {Microbial transformations of cyclic hydrocarbons have received much attention during the past three decades. Interest in the degradation of environmental pollutants as well as in applications of microorganisms in the catalysis of chemical reactions has stimulated research in this area. The metabolic pathways of various aromatics, cycloalkanes, and terpenes in different microorganisms have been elucidated, and the genetics of several of these routes have been clarified. The toxicity of these compounds to microorganisms is very important in the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons, but not many researchers have studied the mechanism of this toxic action. In this review, we present general ideas derived from the various reports mentioning toxic effects. Most importantly, lipophilic hydrocarbons accumulate in the membrane lipid bilayer, affecting the structural and functional properties of these membranes. As a result of accumulated hydrocarbon molecules, the membrane loses its integrity, and an increase in permeability to protons and ions has been observed in several instances. Consequently, dissipation of the proton motive force and impairment of intracellular pH homeostasis occur. In addition to the effects of lipophilic compounds on the lipid part of the membrane, proteins embedded in the membrane are affected. The effects on the membrane-embedded proteins probably result to a large extent from changes in the lipid environment; however, direct effects of lipophilic compounds on membrane proteins have also been observed. Finally, the effectiveness of changes in membrane lipid composition, modification of outer membrane lipopolysaccharide, altered cell wall constituents, and active excretion systems in reducing the membrane concentrations of lipophilic compounds is discussed. Also, the adaptations (e.g., increase in lipid ordering, change in lipid/protein ratio) that compensate for the changes in membrane structure are treated.},

abstract = {Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) additions to soils can have large impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling. As the soil microbial community drives SOC fluxes, understanding how PyOM additions affect soil microbes is essential to understanding how PyOM affects SOC. We studied SOC dynamics and surveyed soil bacterial communities after OM additions in a field experiment. We produced and mixed in either 350 °C corn stover PyOM or an equivalent initial amount of dried corn stover to a Typic Fragiudept soil. Stover increased SOC-derived and total CO2 fluxes (up to 6x), and caused rapid and persistent changes in bacterial community composition over 82 days. In contrast, PyOM only temporarily increased total soil CO2 fluxes (up to 2x) and caused fewer changes in bacterial community composition. Of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that increased in response to PyOM additions, 70{\%} also responded to stover additions. These OTUs likely thrive on easily mineralizable carbon (C) that is found both in stover and, to a lesser extent, in PyOM. In contrast, we also identified unique PyOM responders, which may respond to substrates such as polyaromatic C. In particular, members of Gemmatimonadetes tended to increase in relative abundance in response to PyOM but not to fresh organic matter. We identify taxa to target for future investigations of the mechanistic underpinnings of ecological phenomena associated with PyOM additions to soil.},

abstract = {The increasing input of anthropogenically derived nitrogen (N) to ecosystems raises a crucial question: how does available N modify the decomposer community and thus affects the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). Moreover, N input modifies the priming effect (PE), that is, the effect of fresh organics on the microbial decomposition of SOM. We studied the interactive effects of C and N on SOM mineralization (by natural 13C labelling adding C4-sucrose or C4-maize straw to C3-soil) in relation to microbial growth kinetics and to the activities of five hydrolytic enzymes. This encompasses the groups of parameters governing two mechanisms of priming effects - microbial N mining and stoichiometric decomposition theories. In sole C treatments, positive PE was accompanied by a decrease in specific microbial growth rates, confirming a greater contribution of K-strategists to the decomposition of native SOM. Sucrose addition with N significantly accelerated mineralization of native SOM, whereas mineral N added with plant residues accelerated decomposition of plant residues. This supports the microbial mining theory in terms of N limitation. Sucrose addition with N was accompanied by accelerated microbial growth, increased activities of $\beta$-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase, and decreased activities of xylanase and leucine amino peptidase. This indicated an increased contribution of r-strategists to the PE and to decomposition of cellulose but the decreased hemicellulolytic and proteolytic activities. Thus, the acceleration of the C cycle was primed by exogenous organic C and was controlled by N. This confirms the stoichiometric decomposition theory. Both K- and r-strategists were beneficial for priming effects, with an increasing contribution of K-selected species under N limitation. Thus, the priming phenomenon described in 'microbial N mining' theory can be ascribed to K-strategists. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The effects of five short-chain organic acids (SCOAs) on the behaviors of pyrene in soil-water system were investigated The influences of the quantity and species of organic acids, pH, and soil dissolved organic matter were considered The results showed the presence of SCOAs inhibited the adsorption and promoted the desorption of pyrene in the following order: citric acid {\textgreater} oxalic acid {\textgreater} tartaric acid {\textgreater} lactic acid {\textgreater} acetic acid. The decreased extents of pyrene adsorption performance enhanced with increasing SCOA concentrations, while the decreasing rate became less pronounced at high SCOA concentrations. In the presence of organic acids, the adsorption ability of pyrene decreased with increasing pH. However, there was a slight increase of pyrene adsorption with the addition of oxalic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid above pH 8. The capacity for pyrene retention differentiated significantly between the soils with and without dissolved organic matter. The presence of SCOAs was also favorable for the decrease of pyrene adsorption on soil without dissolved organic matter. The results of this study have important implications for the remediation of persistent organic pollutants in soil and groundwater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved},

abstract = {Background:The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.Results:Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.Conclusions:The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor. {\textcopyright} 2013 McMurdie, Holmes.},

However, knowledge on the assembly of rhizospheric communities in aged-contaminated industrial soils is still limited, especially with regard to transcriptionally active microbiomes and their link to the quality or quantity of carbon sources. We compared the short-term (2–10 days) dynamics of bacterial communities and potential PAH-degrading bacteria in bare or ryegrass-planted aged-contaminated soil spiked with phenanthrene, put in relation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution. Both resident and active bacterial communities (analyzed from DNA and RNA, respectively) showed higher species richness and smaller dispersion between replicates in planted soils. Root development strongly favored the activity of Pseudomonadales within the first 2 days, and of members of Actinobacteria, Caulobacterales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales within 6–10 days. Plants slowed down the dissipation of phenanthrene, while root exudation provided a cocktail of labile substrates that might preferentially fuel microbial growth. Although the abundance of PAH-degrading genes increased in planted soil, their transcription level stayed similar to bare soil. In addition, network analysis revealed that plants induced an early shift in the identity of potential phenanthrene degraders, which might influence PAH dissipation on the long-term.},

abstract = {In agriculture, water consumption for crop production represents 69{\%} of all water use. Precision irrigation systems based on available soil water have been developed to improve crop production, reducing water use. Besides the improvements in irrigation management, a better resolution of the optimal water level is required, and revealing the impact of soil matric potential on the soil microbial community may help. Here, the effect of four soil matric potential treatments (-15 kPa, -25 kPa, -30 kPa, and -45 kPa) was evaluated on the soil microbial community across three potato cultivars and two soil types (silt and sand). The results confirmed the soil matric potential with -25 kPa as the optimal irrigation level, which promoted high potato production using the minimal water use. The irrigation levels affected the composition, predicted functionality, and the ecological network of soil bacterial community. Water excess (-15 kPa) and deficit (-30 and -45 kPa) promoted an increase in microbial interaction and alpha-diversity. The results suggested higher Positive/Negative ratio for phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria in optimal irrigation level (-25 kPa) than other irrigation levels. Also, correlation analyses revealed an interesting association between the irrigation levels, potato production, and bacterial functionality, especially in the carbon cycle (fixation and emission). Therefore, this study proposed important associations between the soil bacterial community and water management, focusing on high potato production and minimal water use. The advancement of this knowledge may lead to a more comprehensive assessment of the optimal irrigation levels of others crop production systems. Furthermore, the inclusion of biological mechanisms, especially microbial interactions, in agriculture studies has the potential to contribute to the development of water management practices conducive to both increasing crop yield and maintaining a sustainable soil environment.},

abstract = {Despite advances in physicochemical remediation technologies, in situ bioremediation treatment based on Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) reductive dechlorination activity remains a cornerstone approach to remedy sites impacted with chlorinated ethenes. Selecting the best remedial strategy is challenging due to uncertainties and complexity associated with biological and geochemical factors influencing Dhc activity. Guidelines based on measurable biogeochemical parameters have been proposed, but contemporary efforts fall short of meaningfully integrating the available information. Extensive groundwater monitoring data sets have been collected for decades, but have not been systematically analyzed and used for developing tools to guide decision-making. In the present study, geochemical and microbial data sets collected from 35 wells at five contaminated sites were used to demonstrate that a data mining prediction model using the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm can provide improved predictive understanding of a sites reductive dechlorination potential. The CART model successfully predicted the 3-month-ahead reductive dechlorination potential with 75.8{\%} and 69.5{\%} true positive rate (i.e., sensitivity) for the training set and the test set, respectively. The machine learning algorithm ranked parameters by relative importance for assessing in situ reductive dechlorination potential. The abundance of Dhc 16S rRNA genes, CH4, Fe2+, NO3-, NO2-, and SO42- concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) amounts, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) displayed significant correlations (p {\textless} 0.01) with dechlorination potential, with NO3-, NO2-, and Fe2+ concentrations exhibiting precedence over other parameters. Contrary to prior efforts, the power of data mining approaches lies in the ability to discern synergetic effects between multiple parameters that affect reductive dechlorination activity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that data mining techniques (e.g., machine learning algorithms) effectively utilize groundwater monitoring data to derive predictive understanding of contaminant degradation, and thus have great potential for improving decision-making tools. A major need for realizing the predictive capabilities of data mining approaches is a curated, open-access, up-to-date and comprehensive collection of biogeochemical groundwater monitoring data.},

abstract = {A critical feature of leaf litter decay is the interaction between holocellulose (including both cellulose and hemicellulose) and lignin, described by the lignocellulose index (LCI): LCI=lignin/[lignin+ holocellulose], which increases during decomposition. We develop a simple model describing the relationships between the first-order decay rate coefficients (k2 and k3, respectively) for holocellulose (C2) and lignin (C3) litter fractions over the full range of LCI values from 0 to an empirical maximum of {\~{}}0.7 (LCImax). We assume that: (1) k2 and k3 are linear functions of LCI; (2) holocellulose degradation (dC2/dt) provides a net energy yield, while lignin decay (dC3/dt) has a net energy cost; and (3) LCImax is the LCI value at which the yield of dC2/dt equals the cost of dC3/dt. This model is consistent with empirical observations of key aspects of litter decay, such as changes in LCI, and can be used to quantify energetic relationships during decomposition, such as the relationship between potential carbon use efficiency (CUE) and litter quality (LCI). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbon catabolic genes were investigated in soils and sediments in nine different locations around Syowa Station, Antarctica, using conventional PCR, real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing analysis. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD)-coding genes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Clone libraries of Gram-positive RHD genes were related to (i) nidA3 of Mycobacterium sp. py146, (ii) pdoA of Terrabacter sp. HH4, (iii) nidA of Diaphorobacter sp. KOTLB, and (iv) pdoA2 of Mycobacterium sp. CH-2, with 95–99 {\%} similarity. Clone libraries of Gram-negative RHD genes were related to the following: (i) naphthalene dioxygenase of Burkholderia glathei, (ii) phnAc of Burkholderia sartisoli, and (iii) RHD alpha subunit of uncultured bacterium, with 41–46 {\%} similarity. Interestingly, the diversity of the Gram-positive RHD genes found around this area was higher than those of the Gram-negative RHD genes. Real-time PCR showed different abundance of dioxygenase genes between locations. Moreover, the PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile demonstrated diverse bacterial populations, according to their location. Forty dominant fragments in the DGGE profiles were excised and sequenced. All of the sequences belonged to ten bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Cyanobacteria, Chlorobium, and Acidobacteria. In addition, the bacterial genus Sphingomonas, which has been suggested to be one of the major PAH degraders in the environment, was observed in some locations. The results demonstrated that indigenous bacteria have the potential ability to degrade PAHs and provided information to support the conclusion that bioremediation processes can occur in the Antarctic soils and sediments studied here.},

Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated soils were treated for a period of up to 64 days in situ (HCH dumpsite, Lucknow) and ex situ (University of Delhi) in line with three bioremediation approaches. The first approach, biostimulation, involved addition of ammonium phosphate and molasses, while the second approach, bioaugmentation, involved addition of a microbial consortium consisting of a group of HCH-degrading sphingomonads that were isolated from HCH contaminated sites. The third approach involved a combination of biostimulation and bioaugmentation. The efficiency of the consortium was investigated in laboratory scale experiments, in a pot scale study, and in a full-scale field trial. It turned out that the approach of combining biostimulation and bioaugmentation was most effective in achieving reduction in the levels of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-HCH and that the application of a bacterial consortium as compared to the action of a single HCH-degrading bacterial strain was more successful. Although further degradation of $\beta$- and $\delta$-tetrachlorocyclohexane-1,4-diol, the terminal metabolites of $\beta$- and $\delta$-HCH, respectively, did not occur by the strains comprising the consortium, these metabolites turned out to be less toxic than the parental HCH isomers.},

The present review discusses the selection of pesticide-utilising microorganisms from various sources, their potential for the degradation of pesticides from different chemical classes in liquid media as well as soil-related case studies in a laboratory, a greenhouse and field conditions. The paper is focused on the microbial degradation of the most common pesticides that have been used for many years such as organochlorinated and organophosphorus pesticides, triazines, pyrethroids, carbamate, chloroacetamide, benzimidazole and derivatives of phenoxyacetic acid. Special attention is paid to bacterial strains from the genera Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Brucella, Burkholderia, Catellibacterium, Pichia, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Serratia, Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Streptomyces and Verticillum, which have potential applications in the bioremediation of pesticide-contaminated soils using bioaugmentation technology. Since many factors strongly influence the success of bioaugmentation, selected abiotic and biotic factors such as pH, temperature, type of soil, pesticide concentration, content of water and organic matter, additional carbon and nitrogen sources, inoculum size, interactions between the introduced strains and autochthonous microorganisms as well as the survival of inoculants were presented.},

abstract = {Aims We aim to construct a comprehensive global database of litter decomposition rate (k value) estimated by surface floor litterbags, and investigate the direct and indirect effects of impact factors such as geographic factors (latitude and altitude), climatic factors (mean annual tempePlrature, MAT; mean annual precipitation, MAP) and litter quality factors (the contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and C:N ratio, lignin:N ratio) on litter decomposition. Methods We compiled a large data set of litter decomposition rates (k values) from 110 research sites and conducted simple, multiple regression and path analyses to explore the relationship between the k values and impact factors at the global scale. Important findings The k values tended to decrease with latitude (LAT) and lignin content (LIGN) of litter but increased with temperature, precipitation and nutrient concentrations at the large spatial scale. Single factor such as climate, litter quality and geographic variable could not explain litter decomposition rates well. However, the combination of total nutrient (TN) elements and C:N accounted for 70.2{\%} of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. The combination of LAT, MAT, C:N and TN accounted for 87.54{\%} of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. These results indicate that litter quality is the most important direct regulator of litter decomposition at the global scale. This data synthesis revealed significant relationships between litter decomposition rates and the combination of climatic factor (MAT) and litter quality (C:N, TN). The global-scale empirical relationships developed here are useful for a better understanding and modeling of the effects of litter quality and climate factors on litter decompsotion rates.},

abstract = {The structurally conserved and ubiquitous pathways of central carbon metabolism provide building blocks and cofactors for the biosynthesis of cellular macromolecules. The relative uses of pathways and reactions, however, vary widely among species and depend upon conditions, and some are not used at all. Here we identify the network topology of glucose metabolism and its in vivo operation by quantification of intracellular carbon fluxes from 13C tracer experiments. Specifically, we investigated Agrobacterium tumefaciens, two pseudomonads, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Zymomonas mobilis, and Paracoccus versutus, which grow on glucose as the sole carbon source, represent fundamentally different metabolic lifestyles (aerobic, anaerobic, photoheterotrophic, and chemoheterotrophic), and are phylogenetically distinct (firmicutes, $\gamma$-proteobacteria, and $\beta$-proteobacteria). Compared to those of the model bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, metabolisms of the investigated species differed significantly in several respects: (i) the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was the almost exclusive catabolic route; (ii) the pentose phosphate pathway exhibited exclusively biosynthetic functions, in many cases also requiring flux through the nonoxidative branch; (iii) all aerobes exhibited fully respiratory metabolism without significant overflow metabolism; and (iv) all aerobes used the pyruvate bypass of the malate dehydrogenase reaction to a significant extent. Exclusively, Pseudomonas fluorescens converted most glucose extracellularly to gluconate and 2-ketogluconate. Overall, the results suggest that metabolic data from model species with extensive industrial and laboratory history are not representative of microbial metabolism, at least not quantitatively.},

abstract = {Abstract Whole microbial communities regularly merge with one another, often in tandem with their environments, in a process called community coalescence. Such events impose substantial changes: abiotic perturbation from environmental blending and biotic perturbation of community merging. We used an aquatic mixing experiment to independently unravel the effects of these perturbations on the whole microbiome response and on the success of individual taxa when distinct freshwater and marine communities coalesce. We found that an equal mix of freshwater and marine habitats and blended microbiomes resulted in strong convergence the community structure towards that of the marine microbiome. The enzymatic potential of these blended microbiomes in mixed media also converged toward that of the marine, with strong correlations between the multivariate response patterns of the enzymes and of community structure. Exposing each endmember inocula to an axenic equal mix of their freshwater and marine source waters led to a 96{\%} loss of taxa from our freshwater microbiomes and a 66{\%} loss from our marine microbiomes. When both inocula were added together to this mixed environment, interactions amongst the communities led to a further loss of 29{\%} and 49{\%} of freshwater and marine taxa, respectively. Under both the axenic and competitive scenarios, the diversity lost was somewhat counterbalanced by increased abundance of microbial taxa that were too rare to detect in the initial inocula. Our study emphasizes the importance of the rare biosphere as a critical component of microbial community responses to community coalescence.},

abstract = {Protecting biological diversity with limited resources may require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Most ecosystem models predict that climate warming will stimulate microbial decomposition of soil carbon, producing a positive feedback to rising global temperatures. Although field experiments document an initial increase in the loss of CO 2 from soils in response to warming, in line with these predictions, the carbon dioxide loss from soils tends to decline to control levels within a few years. This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, termed carbon-use efficiency. Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 C. We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

On the basis of early and recurrent detection of their 16S rRNA genes in clone libraries constructed from [C-13]DNA, Hydrogenophaga spp. appeared to dominate biphenyl catabolism in the horseradish rhizosphere soil, whereas Paenibacillus spp. were the predominant biphenyl-utilizing bacteria in the initial bulk soil. Other bacteria found to derive carbon from biphenyl in this nutrient-amended microcosm-based study belonged mostly to the class Betaproteobacteria and were identified as Achromobacter spp., Variovorax spp., Methylovorus spp., or Methylophilus spp. Some bacteria that were unclassified at the genus level were also detected, and these bacteria may be members of undescribed genera. The deduced amino acid sequences of the biphenyl dioxygenase alpha subunits (BphA) from bacteria that incorporated [C-13] into DNA in 3-day incubations of the soils with [C-13] biphenyl are almost identical to that of Pseudomonas alcaligenes B-357. This suggests that the spectrum of the PCB congeners that can be degraded by these enzymes may be similar to that of strain B-357. These results demonstrate that altering the soil environment can result in the participation of different bacteria in the metabolism of biphenyl.},

abstract = {A field study was conducted in the Taihu Lake region, China in 2004 to reveal the organochlorine pesticide concentrations in soils after the ban of these substances in the year 1983. Thirteen organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were analyzed in soils from paddy field, tree land and fallow land. Total organochlorine pesticide residues were higher in agricultural soils than in uncultivated fallow land soils. Among all the pesticides, DDX (DDD, DDE and DDT) had the highest concentration for all the soil samples, ranging from 3.10 ng/g to 166.55 ng/g with a mean value of 57.04 ng/g and followed by HCH, ranging from 0.73 ng/g to 60.97 ng/g with a mean value of 24.06 ng/g. Dieldrin, endrin, HCB and $\alpha$-endosulfan were also found in soils with less than 15 ng/g. Ratios of p,p-(DDD+DDE)/DDT in soils under three land usages were: paddy field {\textgreater} tree land {\textgreater} fallow land, indicating that land usage inlfuenced the degradation of DDT in soils. Ratios of p,p-(DDD+DDE)/DDT {\textgreater}1, showing aged residues of DDTs in soils of the Taihu Lake region. The results were discussed with data from a former study that showed very low actual concentrations of HCH and DDT in soils in the Taihu Lake region, but according to the chemical half-lives and their concentrations in soils in 1980s, the concentration of DDT in soils seemed to be underestimated. In any case our data show that the ban on the use of HCH and DDT resulted in a tremendous reduction of these pesticide residues in soils, but there are still high amounts of pesticide residues in soils, which need more remediation processes.},

abstract = {Beta diversity can be defined as the variability in species composition among sampling units for a given area. We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Correlation coefficients are most popular in statistical practice for measuring pairwise variable associations. Compositional data, carrying only relative information, require a different treatment in correlation analysis. For identifying the association between two compositional parts in terms of their dominance with respect to the other parts in the composition, symmetric balances are constructed, which capture all relative information in the form of aggregated logratios of both compositional parts of interest. The resulting coordinates have the form of logratios of individual parts to a (weighted) “average representative” of the other parts, and thus, they clearly indicate how the respective parts dominate in the composition on average. The balances form orthonormal coordinates, and thus, the standard correlation measures relying on the Euclidean geometry can be used to measure the association. Simulation studies provide deeper insight into the proposed approach, and allow for comparisons with alternative measures. An application from geochemistry (Kola moss) indicates that correlations based on symmetric balances serve as a sensitive tool to reveal underlying geochemical processes.},

abstract = {The analysis of amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes has become the most important single approach for microbial diversity studies. The new sequencing technologies allow for sequencing thousands of reads in a single run and a cost-effective option is split into a single run across many samples. However for this type of investigation the key question that needs to be answered is how many samples can be sequenced without biasing the results due to lack of sequence representativeness? In this work we demonstrated that the level of sequencing effort used for analyzing soil microbial communities biases the results and determines the most effective type of analysis for small and large datasets. Many simulations were performed with four independent pyrosequencing-generated 16S rRNA gene libraries from different environments. The analysis performed here illustrates the lack of resolution of OTU-based approaches for datasets with low sequence coverage. This analysis should be performed with at least 90{\%} of sequence coverage. Diversity index values increase with sample size making normalization of the number of sequences in all samples crucial. An important finding of this study was the advantage of phylogenetic approaches for examining microbial communities with low sequence coverage. However, if the environments being compared were closely related, a deeper sequencing would be necessary to detect the variation in the microbial composition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For most problems in science and engineering we can obtain data sets that describe the observed system from various perspectives and record the behavior of its individual components. Heterogeneous data sets can be collectively mined by data fusion. Fusion can focus on a specific target relation and exploit directly associated data together with contextual data and data about system's constraints. In the paper we describe a data fusion approach with penalized matrix tri-factorization (DFMF) that simultaneously factorizes data matrices to reveal hidden associations. The approach can directly consider any data that can be expressed in a matrix, including those from feature-based representations, ontologies, associations and networks. We demonstrate the utility of DFMF for gene function prediction task with eleven different data sources and for prediction of pharmacologic actions by fusing six data sources. Our data fusion algorithm compares favorably to alternative data integration approaches and achieves higher accuracy than can be obtained from any single data source alone.},

Datasets collected by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 16S rRNA gene amplimers, metagenomes or metatranscriptomes are commonplace and being used to study human disease states, ecological differences between sites, and the built environment. There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

abstract = {Ability to degrade high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been found in diverse species of fast-growing mycobacteria. This study included several PAH-degrading mycobacteria from heavily contaminated sites and an uncontaminated humus soil in the Natural Park, Schw{\"{a}}bische Alb, Germany. The numerical analysis with a total of 131 tests showed that isolates from humus soil and contaminated sites had similar substrate utilization patterns for primary alcohols from ethanol to pentanol, 1,4-butanediol, benzyl alcohol, hexadecane, ethyl acetate, fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and pyrene as the sole carbon and energy (C/E) sources. Significant differences between the two subgroups isolated from humus soil and contaminated sites were observed in the utilization of polyalcoholic sugars, including adonitol, D-arabitol, L-arabitol, erythritol, inositol, rhamnose, sorbitol, and xylitol. Among isolates from humus soil, strain PYR100 showed high similarity in 16S rDNA sequence with M. vanbaalenii strain PYR-1 (=DSM 7251, 100{\%}) and M. austroafricanum ATCC 33464 (99.9{\%}). In addition to the numerical analysis, the 16S-23S intergenic spacer sequence was useful for discriminating between the closely related strains PYR100 and PYR-1 (98{\%} similarity). The patterns of the variable V2 and V3 regions in the ribosomal RNA gene corresponding to Escherichia coli positions 179 to 197 and 1006 to 1023, respectively, were useful for dividing fast-growing and thermosensitive PAH-degrading mycobacteria into ten subgroups consistent with the phylogenetic positions. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {Most ecosystem models predict that climate warming will stimulate microbial decomposition of soil carbon, producing a positive feedback to rising global temperatures. Although field experiments document an initial increase in the loss of CO 2 from soils in response to warming, in line with these predictions, the carbon dioxide loss from soils tends to decline to control levels within a few years. This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, termed carbon-use efficiency. Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 C. We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {1. Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The 'marginal' testing method implemented in the 'vegan' R package and the 'forward' testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the 'marginal' and 'forward' testing methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {The prevalence of chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide uptake by cbemoorganotrophic bacteria has been investigated. Thirteen bacterial species were observed to sorb and concentrate (bioconcentrate) alpha-chlordane, beta-chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, and lindane from aqueous systems. Bioconcentration, as expressed by the ratio of cellular insecticide in ng/mg (dry wt) to supernatant insecticide in ng/mu l, ranged from 10 for lindane by Enterobacter aerogenes to a high of 55,900 for beta-chiordane by Caulobacter vibrioides var. limonus. Amounts of cellular chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides (CHI) detected and the bioconcentration ratios were observed to have the following order in magnitude: alpha- or beta-chlordane {\textgreater} dieldrin {\textgreater} heptachlor epoxide {\textgreater} lindane. This decreasing order was the inverse of reported water solubilities for the CHI and the inverse relationship was mathematically defined. The CHI were not easily removed from cells by washing (desorbing) and desorption was directly proportional to insecticide water solubility. Uptake of the CHI was rapid, near-maximum amounts being sorbed within 15 min, and pH 7 appeared optimal for bioconcentration as examined over the range pH 6 to 8. Implications of this investigation are that bioconcentration of CHI by bacteria might serve as a means of introducing these toxic compounds into aquatic food chains and that the bioconcentration phenomenon might lend itself as a treatment procedure for the intentional removal of residual CHI from water supplies and wastewater.},

abstract = {Due to differences in mineralogical composition and organic matter density, soil particle size fractions (PSF) provide different surface properties and micro-environments, which may affect the adsorption of chemicals and select for distinct microbial communities. Using soils from a long-term fertilisation experiment, we examined the structural diversity of microbial communities associated with different PSF and their potential to mineralise two organic pollutants (phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP)). The soils were taken from 0 to 18 cm depth of arable field plots that have been kept unfertilised (UNF), mineral fertilised (NPK), or treated with animal manure (AM) for 117 years. Sand, including particulate organic matter (POM), coarse silt, fine silt, and clay were isolated by gentle ultra-sonication, wet-sieving and centrifugation. Animal manuring increased the abundance of the three microbial domains Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi, with coarse silt being most responsive. The impact of manuring declined with decreasing particle size. Genetic profiling indicated that the composition of the bacterial communities was primarily shaped by soil particle size classes, while archaea responded predominantly to fertilisation. Particle size as well as fertilisation was equally important in structuring the fungal communities. All PSF showed capacity for phenol mineralisation with rates correlating negatively with particle size (except for the sand-POM fraction), and long-term fertilisation enhanced the mineralisation potential. In contrast, DCP mineralisation was associated with the clay fraction only and was highest for soil treated with mineral fertiliser. This study demonstrates that PSF harbour structurally distinct microbial communities with different functional potentials for mineralising organic pollutants.},

abstract = {A conceptual model emphasizing direct host-microbe interactions has dominated work on host-associated microbiomes. To understand plant-microbiome associations, however, broader influences on microbiome composition and functioning must be incorporated, such as those arising from plant-plant and microbe-microbe interactions. We sampled soil microbiomes associated with target plant species (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Lespedeza capitata, Lupinus perennis) grown in communities varying in plant richness (1-, 4-, 8- or 16-species). We assessed Streptomyces antagonistic activity and analysed bacterial and Streptomyces populations via 454 pyrosequencing. Host plant species and plant richness treatments altered networks of coassociation among bacterial taxa, suggesting the potential for host plant effects on the soil microbiome to include changes in microbial interaction dynamics and, consequently, co-evolution. Taxa that were coassociated in the rhizosphere of a given host plant species often showed consistent correlations between operational taxonomic unit (OTU) relative abundance and Streptomyces antagonistic activity, in the rhizosphere of that host. However, in the rhizosphere of a different host plant species, the same OTUs showed no consistency, or a different pattern of responsiveness to such biotic habitat characteristics. The diversity and richness of bacterial and Streptomyces communities exhibited distinct relationships with biotic and abiotic soil characteristics. The rhizosphere soil microbiome is influenced by a complex and nested array of factors at varying spatial scales, including plant community, plant host, soil edaphics and microbial taxon and community characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

@article{Rocca2019c,
abstract = {Abstract Whole microbial communities regularly merge with one another, often in tandem with their environments, in a process called community coalescence. Such events impose substantial changes: abiotic perturbation from environmental blending and biotic perturbation of community merging. We used an aquatic mixing experiment to independently unravel the effects of these perturbations on the whole microbiome response and on the success of individual taxa when distinct freshwater and marine communities coalesce. We found that an equal mix of freshwater and marine habitats and blended microbiomes resulted in strong convergence the community structure towards that of the marine microbiome. The enzymatic potential of these blended microbiomes in mixed media also converged toward that of the marine, with strong correlations between the multivariate response patterns of the enzymes and of community structure. Exposing each endmember inocula to an axenic equal mix of their freshwater and marine source waters led to a 96{\%} loss of taxa from our freshwater microbiomes and a 66{\%} loss from our marine microbiomes. When both inocula were added together to this mixed environment, interactions amongst the communities led to a further loss of 29{\%} and 49{\%} of freshwater and marine taxa, respectively. Under both the axenic and competitive scenarios, the diversity lost was somewhat counterbalanced by increased abundance of microbial taxa that were too rare to detect in the initial inocula. Our study emphasizes the importance of the rare biosphere as a critical component of microbial community responses to community coalescence.},
